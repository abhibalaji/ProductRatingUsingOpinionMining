Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,"Moto G (2nd Gen) Hidden Features, Known Issues & Solutions","First of all I would like to confirm that You made a right choice if you have bought this phone.  While decided to buy a new phone i was so confused between the Moto G (2nd Gen) and ASUS ZenFone 5 (16GB).  After doing a lot of research online i found Asus ZenFone 5 Battery is not good when you use 3G Internet or Play Games.  So Here I am not going to share the specification of this phone rather i will focus on some hidden features and known issues and their solutions.  FOR YOUR INFORMATION: 1) This phone support 3g network in only SIM Slot 1. 2) No File Manager installed (You need to download ES File Explorer from Play Store) 3) Simple Stock UI result in Smooth performance. 4) No Lags at all. 5) Guaranteed Android and Security Updates for 18 Months. 6) Battery average (12 Hour Backup with wifi and 3g network on, 1 hour of internet surfing, 30 minutes of gaming, 1 hour of whatsapp, 2 hour of music, some phone calls and 10 minutes of camera use). 7) Fast Startup & ShutDown. 8) Premium Look and Display.  THINGS TO DO AFTER BUYING THIS PHONE? 1) Go to Settings>>About Phone and tap 5 times on Build number to enable developer mode. 2) Go to Settings>>Developer options and Select runtime: Use ART. This will help you save more ram and longer battery life. Doing this will ask you restart the phone.. it may take some times depends on the number of apps you have installed. (You will not lose any of your apps.) 3) Once ART runtime mode is enabled, again navigate to Settings>>Developer options and UNcheck Don't keep activities.. This will help you if you do multitasking. Note: Do not use ART runtime if you restart your phone very frequently as everytime it will take time to optimize apps on the startup. 4) Disable System Apps if you don't use them. For me these includes: Drive, Email, Gmail, Google Korean Keyboard, Google Pinyin Input, Google Play Books, Google Play Games, Google Play Movies, Google Play Newsstand, Google+, Maps, Motorola Alert, Motorola Migrate. Note: You may install K-9 mail as default mail app. i am sure you are gonna love it. Dont forget to disable sync and notifications.  KNOWN ISSUES AND SOLUTIONS 1) This phone lacks an option for WCDMA ONLY mode. To force stay on 3g network, Download ""NETWORK"" by ""PHILIPP MANGELOW"" from play store and select WCDMA ONLY. 2) Notification Bar does not contain quick toggle and it redirects you to the setting menu. To enable quick toggle in notification bar, Download ""NOTIFICATION TOGGLE"" by ""J4VELIN"" from Play Store and customize it according to your needs. There is an option for radio toggles too, so if you install this app then you do not need to install NETWORK from play store. 3) If your music sound goes wired on full volume then use 320 KBPS Original Music files only and / or Go to Settings>>Sound>>Audio Effect and Turn it OFF.  TIPS AND TRICKS 1) Before installing any application, make sure you read all the permission ask by the app developer. 2) Never ever install TrueCaller on your phone because this app sends your contacts to their server and voids the privacy. 3) Always keep Notifications OFF for any app, this will help you save more ram and longer battery backup. You can do it in two ways: (i) Go to particular app>>settings turn all notification off. (ii) Go to Settings>>Apps, select app and UNcheck Show Notifications. 4) Keep your WiFi and Data OFF when you don't need it. 5) Do not install Facebook App and FB Messenger as they will eat more than 110mb of ram.  WHY MOTO G (2ND GEN) AND WHY NOT ASUS ZENFONE 5 (16GB) 1) OPERATING SYSTEM: Moto G Comes with Android 4.4.4 KitKat and is Upgradable to Android 5.0 Lollipop or later for 1.5 years. ASUS ZenFone 5 comes with Android 4.3 JellyBean and is Upgradable to 4.4.2. An update from ASUS confirms that Lollipop will arrive later in June 2015 but no guarantee. 2) PROCESSOR: Moto G Runs on 1.2 GHZ SnapDragon ARM based Processor, On the other hand ASUS runs on 1.6 GHZ Intel x86 based processor. The point here is most of the (99%)android apps are designed to run on an ARM based cpu. 3) RAM: Moto G has 1 GB of RAM and runs on simple stock android and contains no junkware. ASUS has 2GB of ram in which 800 MB is already used by the heavy UI and preinstalled apps that can not be disabled. 4) UI: ASUS wins in the case of User Interface because its ZEN UI is very very beautiful and user friendly. Moto G has Simple stock UI. 5) GPU: Moto is FAR Better in gaming than the Asus as its contains Aderno GPU.  FLIPKART SERVICE Paid Extra 90 Rupees and Get phone after 2 day. POOR SERVICE.  So friends, if you find this review useful then spread this review so that all the users of Moto G can take advantage.",94% of 182 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,Asus zenfone 5 vs Moto g 2nd gen vs Xiomi Redmi 1s,"Writing this review after using all the three phone  I had bought the zenfone 5 just after the launch but after one month of continuous use I realized that it had some fault in the hearing speaker. I checked with my friends zenfone and it was perfectly OK. Flipkart was courteous enough to refund the same. After that I bought moto g new edition. I am not writing the specs comparison which you can get easily at Flipkart and its deceiving sometimes as on paper they may claim heaven but what matters is real performance. I am writing this one for helping the confused buyers considering the user experience and the things which are not compared/ highlighted in online reviews but matters a lot.  Design and build:  Both have the good build quality but I liked the moto g as it feels comfortable to hold. moto g is very soft on hand and for the same screen size its dimensions are less and thus easy to operate. Zenfone has a bigger form factor and the design is edgy so while holding in one hand or while talking its edges hurt. Xiomi Redmi 1s is old school basic design with solid feel but @160g weight its too heavy to carry around.  Display:  Though on paper both have the same specs but the colors are more stunning and vivid on zenfone 5 it feels like an amoled screen. Moto g looks a bit washed out. Xiomi Redmi 1s on paper has the same HD screen but it has a yellowish tinge in the screen and black is not true black as in Moto G so colour contrast is not that impressive.  Processor: All the three have equally powerful processor not much difference.  Multitasking:  Though moto g has the less ram but as it runs vanilla android its requirement is also less so again it's equal in both and I did not find any lag in both.  User experience: zenui wins here as it gives many enhancements over the stock android but after android l upgrade on moto g the situation will completely change. Xiomi Redmi 1s MIUI is like a copy of iOS with lots of improvements but I didnt like personally as it doesnt look modern.  Gaming: I played heavy games like Injustice: Gods among us, Asphalt:8 & Real Racing on both the phones. In this aspect the Zenfone 5 is clear winner as you can play almost all the games in best graphics setting without lag but again be ready keep a charger beside phone as it will eat your battery at approx 10% per 15 min.  If someone is expecting a great gaming experience in Moto g is not for you the above games runs flawlessly on Moto G at medium graphics setting. At high graphics setting the games may close in between due to low RAM but again Battery performance is much better here its 10% per 30 min. Pls dont expect Xiomi Redmi 1s for heavy games it will get so hot that you may not be able to hold it. Camera:  Camera in both the devices are equally good but the default camera app on moto g is pathetic. I installed Google camera app and its great.  Battery: This is the biggest con for zenfone 5. I had to carry my charger all the time. The battery management of Intel processors is still novice. I was traveling on train with GPS on as I was traveling for the first time to this place and the battery ran down from 99% to 30% in just 4.5 hours and still 2 hours journey left. What's the use of such phone which doesn't help in such situations. moto g is satisfactory in this aspect if not great as Qualcomm professors are frugal. Xiomi Redmi 1s is OK in its price range but not great think that it consumes more battery due to heating of the device even on smallest of applications.  Sound: The sound in the Zenfone 5 is really very low and in this aspect the Moto G is way ahead. Moto G is a great media device. Xiomi Redmi 1s s OK in its price range.  The discission completely depends on buyer but for me the battery life is more important compared to any other features so I prefer moto g although a bit pricey.  Note: Xiomi Redmi 1s has improved in the heating department after the latest update from company but it still gets heated up. it took 3 updates from the company with each apprx 30 mb, 300 mb & 512 mb respectively. So make sure you have a broad band to be able to install these updates.",91% of 1022 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

So after i got my product i first charged it to 100% and kept it for 8hours charging i dont know whether that helps but someone had told me that first time longer charging helps... To tell u the fact the design of the phone is awesome....its confirtable in hand....5"" screen looks big but handy though.....when i first kept for charging i used the samsung charger which i had becoz i had seen reviews abt the moto charger getting heated..but to my suprise the phone started giving some smell i was not sure what was that...but when i changed my charger to moto charger ...the smell jus went.....so if anyone is having isssues of smell from the phone while charging please use moto charger ...the camera is superb good clicks outside...i tried gaming and other apps but the phone has not issues with heating or any other flaws...there are no flaws in this machine.....its born to lead u...and it will.....amazing touch and also display....crisp and bright....the front two speakers look a bit weird but its ok....cz the design of the phone kills it....many people had issues regarding sim card slots...but i found both my slots very much functional and with good network catch...the phone is fast ...smooth...u can call it ""makkhan""..

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,A good mid-range Android phone.,"Ordered last night just past 12 and received at 2:30 PM today! Fantastic delivery. Couldn't keep up with the tracker's speed :)  Still exploring, will update more later.  Here are the first impressions -   1. Screen: Nice, crisp and vivid, but only 720p. With Snapdragon 400, I guess 720p makes more sense than 1080p. It is 5 inches in size but feels compact and usable in single hand. 2. Performance: Android 4.4.4 comes pre-installed. Lag-free so far. Runs Riptide GP pretty well. Should run all games meant for Snapdragon 400. MS Office, Facebook and Google Drive all work fast and fine.  3. Sound: The front dual speakers are awesome. Very nice sound. None of the other Motos (E/G/X) so far had this kind of fidelity.  4. Camera: 8 MP main cam & 2 MP front. Very good snaps so far both indoors and outdoors. Got only 20 mins to experiment :) 5. Call quality: 2 mics with noise cancellation and a loud speaker! Feels good. 6. Micro SD Slot: This is the greatest inclusion. Moto G sorely missed that. Good option. 7. What else do you want? :) C'mon guys what else do you expect from a phone at this price point? It won't cook your meals or solve your financial problems. Use it practically. It's a good deal. The Moto + Google combination is working out for the masses!  Will get back after a week or so with extended usage report.",88% of 724 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,Bang For Your Buck,"With Xiaomi phones not made available for general public with their show off flash sales, I decided to purchase the Moto G(2nd gen). This handset from the time of launch is still readily available on flipkart :)  I liked the handset look, feel and overall aspects. The Stereo speakers, Camera and additional storage are the biggest upgrades over the previous phones.  The only con in this phone is the very average battery life. If one is a regular user of the phone for browsing, whatsapp, etc several times a day I feel the battery will drain out in about 8-10 hours.   Overall very much satisfied with this phone for a price of Rs 12,999/- and one can buy on demand and not wait for your lucky chance every Tuesday.",96% of 45 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,1 star,Worst customer service and demanding extra money for repairing from Motorola service center Pune-India,"Hi Everyone,  I am initiating this, to appraise you all of the difficulties, Worst Customer Service, demanding 80% phone cost for repairing and wrong suggestions, I got from PC Support Motorola Service center,Pune and Live Assistance of Motorola India.  Recently I have purchased Motorola 2nd Gen mobile from from flipkart. It was working awesome but unfortunately few drops of the water goes inside the phone from the bottom area and it's switched off. So I visited to Motorola service center Pune to repair my mobile. [PC Support]  However I have faced worst customer service from Motorola and following difficulties I have faced in the service center:  1. They opened back panel of my phone and told me about liquid damage, I agree with them and said please repair my mobile. Then the lady who checked my phone said, ""You have to pay 80% mobile phone cost to repair the phone."". It was totally hilarious and shocking for me because they asked me 80% of money of my phone without checking the problem.  2. After I refused to pay them the lady said please repair your mobile from local mobile shop if they can. [This part was very disappointed to me because how can any authorized service center can tell any customer to go unauthorized local shop to repair your mobile. Is this Motorola company provide service after sell in India?]  3. As my phone is new and I don't want to test or experiment on my phone from any local mobile repair shop, I told her, ""Could you please at least check my phone and provide me details which part in the phone is damage exactly?"" Then she asked me to pay 250 Rs to check my phone and said ""We will call you about problem in 4-5 days."" I said OK and asked them about written detailed report of what you checked and which parts are exactly damaged then she again refused and said, ""Our technical guy will call you that's it."" I was very frustrated and paid them 250 Rs to see what they can tell me about damage of my phone.   4. After experiencing this worst service from Motorola service center, I tried to chat with Motorola online chat assistance. I told him what I have faced problem in the service center and asked him, Is it really true, Motorola asked to his customer to pay 80% phone cost to repair mobile phone? But he was not able to answer my questions correctly.  Such kind of unprofessional suggestion and demanding money 80% money without checking problem was not expected out of a authorized service center of Motorola.  How can people will pay Motorola 80% mobile cost to repair faulty phone?  Also, I contacted Flipkart about this problem, however Flipkart Customer care said, ""It's not our problem. Please contact Motorola Service center. We are not responsible after sale service.""  Now I don't know whats is going to happen with my mobile. So I request everyone, Flipkart and Motorola cheating with customers as they are not providing good service after sales. So please don't buy any Moto phone.

Even though of waiting for Redmi 2S But finally bought moto g2. *Got my device with Kitkat on 06-02-2014 immediately lollipop 5.0.2 update was available via OTA. * RAM Usage details:  Kitkat : 300-400 mb free RAM  Lollipop: 400-450 mb free RAM( more free RAM compared to Kitkat for sure )  I used to feel 1 GB RAM is not sufficient but now its ok now. * Feels like Battery performance has improved. * Used Redmi 1S before , Definitely MOTO G2 is better but considering price if you have enough budget go for MOTO G2 else redmi 1S or some other options like Honor holly,Asus Zenfone 5 with 1.6 ghz version. * Camera : Im really satisfied with 8 MP and its good * UI : Is very smooth compared to all other budget phones.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,1 star,Beware: Don't buy this phone.,"PLEASE READ THE COMPLETE REVIEW BEFORE BUYING THE PHONE  This review is not about the specification or about the price or the comparison wrt other products. Its about the end user experience after receiving a faulty device.   I bought this phone on October I did face a lot of issues and got replaced three times and the replaced mobile had more issues than the first mobile.   1st Mobile: WORKED PERFECTLY, no hardware or software issues except for battery, which drained in less than 3hrs. So requested a replacement.   2nd Mobile: Camera issue, Flash issue, Touch stuttering issue, Network drop issue, 3G connectivity issue. Requested replacement.   3rd Mobile: Combine all the above issues, I thought to live with that and suddenly one day the phone crashed while using camera and rebooted. Guess what? the phone got stuck in ""boot loop""(Google It), I call it LIMBO.   4th time: Got refunded. It took me a whole day explaining the ""Flipkart Tech Support"". Some how those people understood my distress call and refunded the money.(You guys know how support works right. pathetic!!!)   Here is my findings and a word of caution to all fellow on-line shoppers  *The phone is great for the price, if you are lucky to get a good one.(Some of my friends bought this phone during the initial sales and they never faced any issues)   *Once replaced you wont get a new phone but a refurbished phone.(APPLIES TO ALL PRODUCTS IN FLIPKART)   *I found that the product went out of stock a week back and it is back in stock now, PLEASE DON'T BUY IT, not all are new phones sold right now in the current lot, many are refurbished model.(Verified from a trusted source)   I am a Sony fanboy, I just wanted to experience the stock android interface. Since Moto G2 offered a good specification at lower price with near stock android I bought this phone. The phone is amazing if you get a good one. From my experience I am never going to buy a cheap phone ever ever ever in my life.   Heading to Sony Smartphone Lounge......",3 of 3 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,You can buy....,"I am going to list only issue noticed with this phone.  1. Gorilla glass : It's picking up scratches!!!!! After 2 weeks of usage, I am seeing hairline scratches.Better to have screen guard or flip cover.  2. Average battery life. That's usual with android OS which has mediocre power management. On Normal usage ( 1 hr phone call, 45 mins songs, facebook, mail check) back up provided is 36 hrs. Have seen people complaining about battery backup. one sugggestion is to try apps like ""Battery doctor"" to optimize battery usage. There are lot of unwanted process which will be running that drains battery so fast.  3. Charger provided is below standard.. its heating up itself and the phone while charging, so I stopped using that. When it comes to ear-bud, it's not worth talking about.  4. Sometimes, camera flash light stays on even after closing camera app (am talking about graceful exit). Have noticed this issue only once. Then ,restarted the phone, flash light stayed for few seconds after reboot, then turned off.  5.Screen picks up finger impression and dust.. its horrible..  6.While listening music, if u receive a call, after attending and hanging up the call, the songs resume with low volume. when u check volume status , volume bar shows full !!!!. expected behaviour is to resume the songs with previous known volum lelvel. Moving to next track resumes to last known volume %.... ugly software.  But there are lot of +ve about this phone which other reviewers pointed out.   Somehow, I feel this phone is very delicate..

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,4 stars,A really nice phone for the price you pay,"Trying to be honest here Delivery : It tooks 6 hours for my phone to reach chennai from bengaluru and 1.5 days to reach me who lives in chennai :P. Seriously are these guys wantedly extending the delivery time because i didn't opt for next day delivery?. Build Quality : This phone has a great build quality. Even though its back cover is removable you can mistake it for an unibody design. It feels very good to hold the phone and the smooth rubbery back is awesome. Its does not provide a great grip at the same time its not slippery. Display : Its really a big phone. This is the 1st time am using a 720p phone and for my eyes the display looks crisp and clear. I don't speak about viewing angles and all. Duh there is only one view in which you are going to use your phone :P. Outdoor visibility will definitely take a blow. There is no pixellation and all. Reaching the top of the screen is fairly easy thanks to the dimple on the back and the back cover material. Apply android L wallpaper on your phone and you are going to see a nexus 5 in your hand :). Speakers : Nothing much to say here. These are just speakers which are in front and thats all. You can be free of worries that you are not going to miss any calls even if the phone lies over a pillow or a bed. Ringtone, alarm and audio in games are fairly loud. But while playing music it is not that impressive. I tried with different music players but the volume is less only. But i don't use speakers to hear songs as i have a good pair of ear phones. Audio quality from ear phones is flawless. Battery life : From the time jelly bean came out battery life in android is a huge miss only and that continues still now. I read somewhere that a good smartphone should last for about 12 hours and if that is the case then this is a good smartphone. Don't expect anything more. And yeah just like others say it takes more time to charge the phone. From 20% it took a solid 2 hours to reach 80%.  Performance : Mark this up. Even after 2 years you will get the same silky smooth performance in this phone. Every thing is buttery smooth and lag free. You can check gaming reviews in youtube to get some idea. Camera : Generally i don't use the camera that much so it won't to be fair for me to speak about the camera. Good to know my phone has an 8MP shooter :D. Things that impressed me : 1. Build quality 2. Stock android experience 3. Call clarity(quality) 4. The price i paid for this experience Things that made me worry : Apart from that network issue nothing else is there for me. Am happy with my phone. Updates(After 3 days of usage) : The network drop issue what i had mentioned earlier is solely my bad. The guy who had cut my sim did not insert it properly. It is a click to insert and remove mechanism. After inserting the sim fully till i got the click i did not face any issue with calls.  Outdoor visibility is fair. If you get any calls or receive a text you will be able to clearly see and read the content. You can even reply without any issues. But reading a full length article is a big no no.  I had mentioned that volume from the speakers while playing songs was low. I tried 3 players Rocket, Poweramp and Google Play Music. Out of these 3 poweramp gives the same loud experience you get during calls or when your alarm is ringing. You can enjoy the speaker quality with poweramp.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,Simply Awesome!!!,"First of all, great service from Flipkart who delivered 2 days before the estimated date. The package arrived in the best condition with the manufacturer's seal intact. I am waiting for the accessories to be available so that I can buy some of them.  Anyways, before I talk about the phone, let me tell you where I come from. I have been a steady fan of Nokia Symbian phones and have been extremely skeptical of Android and the phones they come in. I have been using a Nokia 5800 for many years and then I had tried the Sony Xperia Mini for some time and I didn't like it(very low battery performance and too buggy android). So, I had moved back to Nokia Symbian by buying the Nokia 808 Pureview and had been using it for the last couple of years. So, finally after hearing so much good info about Motorola phones as well as the new Android versions, I decided to give it a try and since google owns Motorola now(although temporarily), and since the technical specs to price ratio is insanely on the good side for consumers, I bought this new Moto-G.   First impressions. This phone is big with a big screen. My earlier 808 was of size 4-inch and for some strange reason I expected the Moto-G to be not different by this much. Anyways, this size is the maximum I can handle for a phone, at-least based on my palm size. People with bigger hands will find this more comfortable to use. The 720p display looks good. I have seen Sony's much hyped Triluminous Bravia powered display when I saw the Xperia Z Ultra at a store. The Moto-G's screen appears to be just as good, especially when you crank up the brightness. Everything is perfectly clear and sharp and unless I look at it closely with a lens, I would say this phone's display is as good as apple's retina display. The touch response is very quick with latency thats almost as low as the iOS devices(try playing drum apps in both and you'll see what I mean).  The body of the phone appears to be well built and sturdy unlike the previous android phone that I owned(same price) and one thing to note here is that the whole body is dust and finger-print resistant. Motorola claims to have the gorilla glass 3 with this phone. Looks like thats good too (Accidently put the phone in my pocket with my car keys and not a single dent or scratch) :) The battery appears to last as Motorola claims, unlike what I heard with the first generation Moto-Gs. I hope its not because this is the early days since purchase :)  Performance. There is a big surprise here for me atleast. The data transfer between your external micro-SD card and the internal memory happens at 20MB/s. I saw this when I tried copying my music from my micro-SD card to the internal memory so as to format the card using the phone. The stock android doesn't come with a file manager in this phone. So, I use this 3rd party file manager called ES File Explorer. The quad-core CPU appears to be great giving no lags on HD video playback and gaming. Although I wouldn't recommend trying to run big uncompressed HD videos as it can't handle it. For gaming, I tried running NFS hot Pursuit and it worked great. Works exactly as how it does in my iPad. Android Kitkat is way better in terms of performance than Jelly Bean or ICS and that transcends complemented by the quad-core CPU.  So, to conclude, the 2nd Gen Moto-G is the best phone you can ever get for that price in the market. No other phone in that price range is even close. So, its a must buy for anyone who is looking for a decent android based smart-phone. I mean, based on what I see here, one has to be almost crazy to go for the high-end models from leading manufacturers that are priced atleast 4-5 times the price of this phone. It really shows how cheap the technology really is and how most manufacturers are overcharging for their products.",3 of 3 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,Proud to Own!!,"I was already a fan of MOTO G since last year, the only reason for not picking was lack of expandable memory.. With this 2nd Generation Launch I must say Motorola has launched a monster which would eat away the charm of ANY other phone!   With 5 inches display it looks really classy.. Looks better than any phone I see around :)   Camera is awesome even for dim lights, good battery, very smooth in operation due to 1gb RAM and quad core processor, excellent graphics and above all extremely sleek and handy!  There are already huge praises all over the website, I would just mention one thing, ppl please open your eyes and buy a phone which values your money.. I don't understand why they have a doubt and say its Motorola I am looking for something in Samsung!! Please!! Same configuration in Samsung would cost you just double and all Samsung phones look alike!! and moreover FYI - Motorola is the oldest company to launch mobiles!   Motorola Powered by Google is the BEST combination anytime with unbelievable price.. I was not expecting 2nd gen to be this low at price! Hats off!!   Also, If you have been delivered a defected piece you can get it replaced instead of talking ill over websites.. even Xperia Z1 was replaced by me 2 months back, that doesn't mean its a bad phone! Its just an electronic device, there are chances of manufacturing faults, check properly when you get, use it extensively for a week, analyze it and get it replaced!!  Just close your eyes and buy it.. you will love it!!",3 of 3 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,2 stars,Battery Life a huge let down!,"Bought this phone the first day it came out and received on 10th Sept. Love the camera, the music,the speed,touch among other things. The battery life is a whole another story. After a full 100% recharge, the phone battery keeps draining itself. The battery just lasts for 3-5 hours top using net,social media apps and music. I had to sign out of all social media apps and switch off the net to save battery but then what is the use of a smart phone. It's very frustrating. Also the charger heats up a lot during charging. People have written reviews saying that their phone battery has lasted up to a whole day if not more using everything. Is my phone faulty. The phone is really good for its price and i would like to have it. Is a replacement possible?? Please get back to me ASAP",5 of 6 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,4 stars,A sweet addon to already an awesome offering.,"First of all : I am reviewing a replacement device and Flipkart did a good job on delivering both. Pros :  1. 5"" Screen offers a great viewing experience, colors are bright and brightness is very good.  2. The dual front speakers are not very loud but get's the job done very well. 3. Micro SD is a nice add on atleast in the Indian market. 4. The latest and the greatest android, also the promise to get the fastest update. 5. Price : A thousand buck less than its predecessor , Motorola nailed it. 6. Availability : Unlike some of the other affordable offerings Motorola has been great in availability. A device is great when you can actually buy it. 7. Build Quality is in similar lines with the previous generation, which by every means is great.  Cons :   1. WIFI Issues : The fact that wifi is latest here, is great but there is a catch. It happens it does not support some access points/router authentication types which generally other devices does. This was why I replaced it in the first place. But in the replacement device the problems were same, then I did some digging, the fact it is 802.11 b/g/n/ac compatible but the authentication type it is compatible is very limited, i.e. WEP(bit encryption m not sure), WPA/WPA2 (this worked for me). and 802.1X Radius. That's it. If your router has some other it will not detect it even.   2. Size : This may not be a problem for some but yes this thing has grown up huge since its predecessor.  3. Battery : 2070 mah used to power 4.5, same is used to power 5.0 , the math is simple here, with not a good outcome.  4. Buttons : This time buttons have a soft touch feel to it. I am not sure about how it feels but the response of the click is certainly not tactile as it had previously.   Overall, Cons other than wifi issues should not have been here considering what we get and what we pay.   Recommended : 8/10",5 of 6 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,Brilliant. Good value for money.,"I purchased this phone on launch day itself have been using it since. I have been very satisfied with the phone and would recommend it to anyone looking for a good spec phone in this price range.   Sound quality is awesome. I played something from gaana.com and it almost felt like the song is playing from my laptop :)  Display is good and touch screen works really well. Swipes are smooth and app launches are fast.  It has 8 MP primary and 2 PM secondary camera and am fairly happy with the cameras, however nothing exceptional about the photos. I believe with 8MP, my samsung S3 took better pics.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,3 stars,Moto g (2nd gen) nothing exciting about it,"I have been using it for about 5 days now..   Pros: 1. 5 inch display  2.

Display is not crisp, it just looks like a stretched out screen of previous moto g with a lower pixel density.  2. Battery drains out very fast (lasted for about 5hr 20 min for extensive usage including wifi, gaming and talking)  3. Phone gets heated up very fast within 45 and can't hold it longer in your hands.  4. The moto g UI is not that great.. Customization has very little options.  5. Camera is ok ok during day. Low light snaps are poor.  6. Headset is of poor quality.  7. Charger doesn't have a usb detachable cable.   My experience with the phone is not great.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,3 stars,The phone is a budget phone with nice features but battery very wek and not last a day,"Hi, I was thinking of buying a LG G pro2. But my laptop crashed owing to motherboard problem. Next day I see this ad in newspaper about Moto G second generation with bigger 5 inch screen and six vouchers , on launch day with rs 3000 off on laptops and lucky first 100 buyers of moto g to get 100 percent cash back. I pressed the buy button.  Moto G arrives next day sharp by 3.00 afternoon from WS retail-a flipkart company (safe to buy from they as they offer 30 day replacement on gadets as against 10 day of other vendors on flipkart and 7 days on snapdeal). The Phone in white with 5 inch screen looked beautiful , even though was packed very simple with no accessory except charger. I did not use phone initially for three days as also have s4 and had another sim which was big and could not fit in moto g. Any how got two sims put in moto g and am using moto g for 3 days now here are observations. PROS : 1.Budget 5 inch hd phone under rs 13000 with good looking white colour compared average s4 samsung black looks 2.Motorola has increased the screen size,and little on battery from 1900 t 2070 mah 3.The phone with 1 gb does not hangs , so far , my s4 with 2gb does hangs and quite smooth to use in that budget compared to other phones in expensive category. 4.DUAL Sim is a big advantage for business class people or who want to use two sims but carry one phone. I do not find many quad core decent brand phones with same dual sim featue in this budget. 5. This moto g set now has expandable memory slot to 32 gb, welcome step. 6.The latest version of android 4.4 on phone will get upgraded to next version immediately.  Now the CONS : 1. Motorola has not increased the battery strenth. A meagre 2070 mah is not sufficient to run phone entire day , if you plan to use dual sim, internet on phone, couple of prints from phone directly,whats app, The battery sadly lasts half a day only even when I have not listened to any music or clicked any picture. any 5 inch phone should have at least 2600 mah battery or no point in buying a phone unless you are okay to charge your phone twice a day. It is here where motorola looses out big time for not giving comparable battery for a 5 inch phone. 2. The processor remains the same as on old moto g but though that does not reduces speed to a great length , but avid gamers (I am not a gamer at all) will like faster processors here. 3. The call reception is okay. But sound quality from receiver is not as great as on a samsung set.It is at acceptable or satisfactory level but not great as on my s4.  Overall a great buy for dual sim functionality , great looks and functionality at budget but big let down on battery. Hence my three stars",6 of 8 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,4 stars,Finally a moto g with a micro sd slot!,"When moto g 1st gen was launched, i was really excited. I thought God finally answered my prayers by intoducing a budget smart phone with all the excellent features i wanted, which no other phone could beat. But then came the dampener, when i looked at the storage feature: Moto g had only 12.9 GB of storage, which will never be enough for my huge music collection. So i was really dissappointed.  Last Friday, when the moto g 2nd gen was launched, i was extremely happy! Finally i got my moto g with a memory card slot! This is now one of my most prized posessions!  The moto g 2 is really awesome! Some of the Pros and Cons that I found are listed below.  Pros: - Big 5"" screen. - Quad core procesor - micro sd card support. - 12.9 GB of internal memory, would be more than enough for all the apps. - 8 MP rear and 2 MP front camera. - Latest Android and guaranteed upgrade to L - Light, handy, rugged and beautiful look, it will be everybody's eye candy! - Gorilla Glass protects the phone from scratches. - flash support and secondary camera - 3G support on both sims  Cons: - micro sim (It was difficult to get a micro sim, so I had to take the risk and cut the mini sim in a local mobile store. - Non-removable battery - 1 GB RAM ( moto could have increased it to atleast 1.5 GB) but it does't affect the performance. - Battery backup not so impressive. It gives average battery life. But The Android L OS is expected to increase the battery backup, so keep your fingers crossed! - FM radio not playable through the speakers:  I have seen many users complaing that the FM radio cannot be payed on the loud speakers.  Here's a solution to play FM radio via speakers: Download the app HF button from the Play store and voila! your problem's solved!

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,"BEST in the market.....AWESOME mobile,worthy to spent.","Before going to review, let me add this that i am a Moto-G(first generation) user also, so i can clearly distinguish both mobiles.   Motorola now came up with brand new Moto-G(2nd generation) mobiles ,keeping all its stack features available and adding few new features that will enhance its market. It looks Moto Market Strategy worked, as it provides high end enhanced features with mid range costs,making mid end & lower end customers to enjoy the high end stuff.  Lets go through Pros & Cons.  Pros: 1) Increasing in size of screen, but still the make the design as portable within single hand. 2)Front end speakers, i am here to assure that double speakers at front end will provides a A-class audio clarity, that not even we seen in high end mobiles. 3) Rear Camera is of 8 MP and provides descent snaps(Even blurred image is occupying 1.5MB,shows the quality) and front cam is 2MP,which is also worth while. 4) provided with SD card option--Expandable upto 32GB. 5)Performance wise no issue, i had few graphic based games installed and tried to play simultaneously, i didn't find any lags & hangs. 6) Smooth touch & nice display intensity. 7) Few enhanced features in KitKat 4.4.4 itself(find difference in setting wallpaper by on screen and widgets are entirely separated from apps inside menu etc..) And all these enhanced features are taken from Android-L for impatience users. 8) Ensured with Android-L update. 9) Nice battery standby.  cons:  Here, it is pretty hard to find cons, since manufacturer is providing best as per ""features vs price"" graph. 1) Pixel density is slightly reduced in 2nd generation, but it is hardly observed to naked eye. (first generation users can identify it as they are accustomed to high pixel density). For new Moto customers its like a feast since other mobiles are not even providing 294ppi display(Samsung Grand/Grand 2 runs on 224ppi & HTCexplorer series on 252ppi) . 2) Larger Icons on display i.e no option to change the icon size.(few websites are saying that it is a stack Android-L feature,but not sure). 3) Battery will drain a bit quicker on 3G network.  Verdict: High End features to Mid range customers. No lags & hangs moreover Android-L upgrade. Nice camera & descent display. That all a common customer expects and Moto delivered it successfully. Motorola+Google combo is going to rock Indian market again via flipkart.",4 of 5 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,1 star,One of the worst phones in the market || Do not buy,"In using this phone just over 30 days, the phone's motherboard was damaged. Flipkart will wash their hands if it is ever a one sec over 30 days,   Motorola's award winning (read pathetic and abysmal) service will make a mockery of your complaint and you will have to wait until eternity to only hear that your damn devise will only be repaired or replaced through one of the used and discarded parts of the other unused devises. Motorola's service sucks and they will care not shit about your complaint.   They don't ever have a full fledged customer care system. Its only a number advertised which if you call, they will place you on hold, only to never come back and then you will disconnect crying.   They will make you call again and again and then finally give you a badly repaired phone which also, has no gaurantee, will work or not.   I have bought Motorola once and resolve to not but it ever in my lifetime again.   A general word of advise for my friends reading - there are many options in the market - never go for Motorola products.   I have another smartphone iPhone 4s and Apple has excellent service - they will replace the phone, in case it has any defects (during the warranty period), no questions asked - that's what you call customer satisfaction. Motorola will make you cry and suffer but will never meet your satisfaction.   They are only interested to make a sale, not to win customers.   Shun Motorola - Will never buy their products again.

Even though I downloaded a APP name"" NETWORK"" i am still not satisfied.  4-you cannot record call / sound even if you download any Recorder app.  5-Although it has given a 8Mp camera but the picture quality is worst than nokia 5Mp / samsung 5Mp/ sony3Mp cameras.  6-you have to download lot off apps to satisfy your minimum needs. No in built use full app. 7-You will get voice crack when you reach maximum volume during call or while listing a music. 8-NO data cable provided.  9- only thing I like in the model is the LOOK.  for me me i am in a absolute loss at this price. rather i would have gone for MICROSOFT newly lunched mobile. If any of your friend have a MOTO G 2nd Gen ,before buying go through all the features . If i had money i would have sued MOTOROLA for its add showing good battery back up. This is the worst ever model by MOTOROLA.",2 of 2 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,1 star,Only False Promises cannot be Trusted,"I had Ordered a Moto G from you shopping site on 23rd Dec and had payed 90 rupees for One Day delivery and it was supposed to be delivered on 24th Dec. Since i had made a mistake from my side on the address part and i requested to change of address on the 24th and the phone was supposed to be delivered on 25th Dec. Even though it was general holiday i had requested the Flipkart executive Pushpa and since had given 100% assurance or 100% guaranteed delivery (what ever you say, which cannot be trusted) on 25th and she also mentioned that she is personally following up with the order and make sure that it will be delivered on 25th itself since it was Christmas Gift. Nobody bothered to get in touch with me on the status of the order, i myself contacted the and i spoke 4-5 times with all different executives and they all said the same.   I waited till 9PM since it was told by your executive that it will be delivered before that time. But my phone was delivered on 25th as promised by all of your Flipkart executives which i had blindly trusted.whatever promise i had made was fulfilled because i trusted you guys. even though i had payed the amount for one day delivery the order was not delivered in one day. And all of executives made false promises which you failed to delivery.  Do you guys understand how much pain i had to go because of guys and do you guys understand 100% assurance or 100% guaranteed delivery meaning or do you guys know to maintain a promise or just pretend to delivery. I made a big mistake in trusting you and trusting your executives promises.   This is last transaction with Flipkart and will never come back to you guys and also i will never refer your guys to anyone.",2 of 2 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,3 stars,"Good Build & Design ,Display, Camera but can not listen clear voice on top speaker when talking to someone. Motorola should solve some problems","I have been using Moto G (2nd Gen) last 3 weeks means flipkart deliver me on 5th december, 2014.Good delivery speed frm flipkart with WS Retail seller. But i face some problem which i tell both Motorola care & flipkart care but no body can solve this issue. Now m going 2 share some thing abt this phone.  If u have 3G net pack then nobody want to get 2g speed and network   So many customer facing the main problem of 3G/WCDMA network in Moto G (2nd Gen) always in dual mode . In india as we know that signal strength in 3G network is not good so in Dual mode Moto phones due to their internal phone setting always prefered 2 g network even if select in 3g network in your phone setting.I told this issue to motorola customer toll free care and flipkart care but no body solve this issue. They told me in this series of moto phone in 3g always in dual mode. Now i have to solve this issue my self and any moto customer can do this procedure as in below   Now,  Open your Phone (Dialler) app{the one which you open while dialling a number}. Enter this code: *#*#4636#*#*  An app known as ""Testing"" will be launched.  Touch the first option ""Phone information"".Don't touch other options.  You will notice a drop-down option above ""turn off Radio"" button. Tap on it. Select the third option ""WCDMA Only"". Wait for a while...  You will see that network has changed to 3G mode in the notification bar. If network doesn't change, touch the ""turn off Radio"" button. you will see your phone's signal are lost. Now again turn it on by tapping on the same button.   Your 3G/HSPA/UMTS must have been enabled now.   CAUTION: Inside the 'Testing' app, don't touch the other settings unless you are sure about them or you will land up in trouble & PHONE MAY DAMAGE.  TIP: If you think remembering or dialling the code is difficult, then you can download the ""Phone Testing"" app from Play Store. It directly opens the ""testing"" options in 1 tap.  But i think Motorola now lenvo should slove this problem.Other Android smart phone maker like Samsung, Micromax have 3 option in their phone setting like u can select Dual mode (2g/3g) or only 2G OR Only 3G/Wcdma.I think Motorola should learn from other manufacturer phone maker and other thing listed in below.    Sound quality is very bad means feel very cracking sound when u are talking to someone no clear voice. irritate to me.   Signal catching strength during travelling specially when u inter in roaming is LOST.Again U have to search network by manually.   Congratulate for very good build and design. No problem in carrying ur phone. Display is good & you can update your phone software both in 3G and Wi-fi (WHEN LOLIPOP UPADTE IS AVAILABLE)  Battery take so much time to charge and drain early if continuously connect in Wi-fi not suited for high end gaming it may be 2500 Mah but in this price range it's ok.  LED light always glow in white not Colorful even if u select other Colour from settting. Moto should pay attention becoz of other phone maker even Micromax giving colorful Notification light   Battery and Phone Signal Notification is not colorful and don't show percentage charge battery, u have to download apps from paly store for percentage.  U can not record audio songs when u are listening Fm. Very disturb ur mood  I think Motorola now Lenvo should come forward and solve this issue.",2 of 2 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,1 star,Worst Phone with services even worst,"Hi - I purchased this phone on 9th Sep, from 28th Oct the phone is in Service center and they are unable to sort out the issue.   The phone had a problem with ear speaker which I felt was not working properly from Day1 and slowly it got worsened. Motorola guys repaired the phone and gave it back to me but they never resolved the issue. I went to the service center and tried check the phone and the phone was still not working. In spite of telling customer care people that this was not software issue they did a software update and never tried to check if phone was working or not. I re-submitted the phone to them at the same time so I gave this phone back to them to get it fully repaired.  The phone is still with the service center from past 2 months and they are unable to even trace the issue with the phone.  I would never recommend anyone to ever buy a Motorola product.",2 of 2 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,1 star,Think before you buy,"I am using this phone for past 2 months. I am facing lot of issues  1. Loss of signal - The cell signal seems to drop randomly and it never fetches again .We need to restart the device. Most horrible thing is we wont know when it is dropping.Once it is dropped then we will be Not Reachable i.e no one can call us. 2. Turn on problems - Even if you click on the power button it does not turn on, acts like switched off mobile. The solution provided in moto site is plug it in charger and hold on Volume down key and the Power key for more than two minutes.They said they will resolve it soon. 3. Camera Flash light - Sometimes the flashlight doesn't turn off even after taking photo we need to restart the device.  I think most of my friends are facing these issues.Anyway there is no other option to wait till moto gives an update to these issues.",2 of 2 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,"""ALL"" You Need To Know...!!","HELLO EVERYONE.. Well Folks, I'm not here to tell you all the specs of the phone or something like that...Everybody knows about the 5 inch screen, Stereo speakers, RAM, camera etc etc... What I want to share is the real experience of the phone. There are quite a lot of myths about the device and I might be able to help the confused lot..!  1. First of all..Many people think that this phone has the same back cover problem which was there in the Moto E, because the design process is the same on the two. Well, that is not the case. The back cover fits perfectly..so no issues with that.. :)  2. People also do think that the BATTERY backup is not as good as the original Moto G. Well, yes up to some extent it IS true, considering the 5 inch display and the same size battery but its not horrific..It still lasts for about a day with mixed usage (like casual gaming, music for an hour or 2 and some surfing). Note that if you are a really heavy user..it would last up to 4.5-5 hours (with Wi-fi, mobile data of course and movies, heavy gaming etc)  3. The STEREO SPEAKERS...yes those are true stereo speakers! We do have a Left channel and a Right channel, but they are by no means GREAT speakers...there is a bit of distortion, specially at loud volumes. Its good for gaming, Youtube videos, movies etc..but when it comes to pure music...the Pro's would not be that happy with it..Although, for average users like me, it is a nice experience.  4. GAMERS..!! This point is for you.. Well, this device certainly can play almost any game in the Playstore without any issues.. BUT it would be nice if you set game graphics to medium. Like for example Asphalt 8..it runs much better when you set the game on Medium settings of graphics. No issues otherwise..  5. CAMERA...Well , yes I mentioned earlier that I am not going to talk about specs..but I cant help.. The front camera (2 megapixel) is exceptionally good..believe me..It does a lot better than front cameras of other phones..and surprisingly the rear camera too performs better than expected. Moreover, in low lighting it does even better than Moto X..yes that;s true..Picture colours, saturation and low lighting images better than Moto X..!  All other factors like Call quality, Signal strengths, connectivity, everything is upto the mark..No need to mention that. Well, all things considered..the performance of this phone is exceptional for this price bracket. This phone is for everyone..Gamers, music lovers(not the pro's), office workers..whoever you are..it piece of beauty is all you need..!! Cheers..! :)",2 of 2 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,4 stars,A few steps Forward!!,"The successor to the 2013 stunner is more of a incremental update, nothing more than that. The fact that I call it incremental is because they have increased the screen size (which decreases the pixel density) , upgraded the cameras from 5 and 1.3 to 8 and 2mp respectively, added the sd card slot and yes of course it ships with Kitkat 4.4.4. The fact that motorola could have used an upgraded processor Snapdragon 410 instead of 400 and bumped up the ram to 2gb which is possible ( see Asus Zenfone 5 for example) and still havent used it takes one star away from it. Now as per my review I have used this device for a week now and have probably tested every aspect of it. As usual we'll have pros and cons as it has been ritualised in flipkart reviews :P PROS 1. Screen, the 720p screen streched over 5 inches, never lets you feel that the pixel density has suffered, in my view though it is an IPS display with Corning gorilla glass 3 on it but it looks and feels just like an AMOLED. Colours are bright and display fares well when viewed in direct sunlight. 2. Software, Kitkat 4.4.4 out of the box provides an experiences just like stock android and actually it is stock android with google now launcher and a few of motorola's apps which are usable especailly the migrate app which helps you in transferring your data from your older phone, and yes since it's stock android you'll get the lollipop 5.0 update weeks after nexus devices get it. 3. Call quality, Motorola made the first mobile phone in the world , so it would not be an overstatement to say that call quality is amazing and havent dropped a single call or had problem in sound clarity over the last week or so, both the speakers work well while calling. 4. Design, some may argue with this but the design is also one of its pros and the overall feel doesnt make you feel that it is a sub 15k phone, well done motorola with the curved design. 5. SD card support, since you get only 12 gb internal storage adding a SD card support has certainly helped moto g overcome a big drawback from last year, it allows you to expand upto 32 gb alongwith which is decent. 6. Performance, overall a strong contender for your daily driver as it offers fluid and smooth performance to breeze through all your social needs and youtube as well as some serious games. CONS 1. Battery, even with moderate to low usage this phone struggles to keep pace and avg battery time would be around 8 hrs with low usage and 5-6 with moderate usage with screen brightness set at auto. 2. Inconsistent Front Firing speakers, you expect the speakers to be loud, but at times they are too loud and the other its like someone whispering something in your ears.  3. Headset, The one provided within the box are of cheap quality, and it will definitely hurt your ears if you use it to watch a movie or so. 4. It takes time to charge the battery up even though its just 2070 mah 5. Ram, 1 GB in my view isnt enough when Asus can accomodate 2GB ram in the similar price tag then moto should have atleast bumped up the ram. Since I tested almost every app and game you can to determine phone's strength while testing fifa 14, nfs most wanted , gta san andreas the absence of sufficient amount of ram was felt. But for daily usage without heavy duty tasks this phone is smooth as butter though lags due to heavy duty apps. 6. Camera, though the primary camera shoots slomo videos at 720p(without audio) the cameras just make you feel you are holding a budget phone. Lack of 1080p video recording even though the chipset supports it, inconsistent photos sometimes over saturated and sometimes under saturated, even the HDR mode provides lacklusture photos as compared to my SE Xperia Pro (2011 made) the camera just gives up. VERDICT The phone looks and feels like a premium phone and is pocket friendly and gives you the performance you expect from a phone in this price tag, lags a bit when installed lots of apps but will surely sail you through all your daily requirements. In the end YES it's a bang for buck device. GO FOR IT!",2 of 2 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,4 stars,The king of mid-rangers.,"My first review here on flipkart. Its been more than a month since I purchased the new moto g and the time is just right to pen down my thoughts about it after spending almost every hour with this beauty for a month. First and foremost, kudos to the Flipkart team for delivering it ahead of schedule. When it comes to the device itself, let me tell you it currently is the undisputed king of the mid range tier of smartphones. I dont think any other OEM has a device on the market that offers a phone with a snapdragon 400, 1 gig of RAM and a promise of timely updated for less than 15K. Im excluding the likes of phones with those stupid mediatek crap and the ones with intel (asus zenfone) as im still skeptical about those phones when it comes to the performance, developer support and so on. I also exclude xiaomi because xiaomi phones are still hard to get and you have to rely on third party sites like ebay, olx etc to buy one and there are chances of many being fake. Beware! Ill put down some pros and cons. Please read them (you can thank me later) ;).  Pros:  Build: The phone has a very good build quality. Has an easily removable back panel which has a rubberized matte finish to it. The phone is slim and feels good to hold. You get the feeling of holding a premium phone. The power and volume button are very responsive though they feel a bit wobbly.  Performance: I couldnt have been happier. The phone is extremely snappy. One of the advantages of running stock, clean android without any gimmicky junk that other OEMs add. Backed by a powerful mid-range processor the snapdragon 400 and 1 gig of RAM, this should suffice for everyday needs with occasional gaming. I tried playing dead trigger 2, which runs smooth 90% of the times and asphalt 8, which I felt it was laggy. But a couple of other reviews showed asphalt 8 running smoothly.  Call quality: I dont tend to get too many voice calls but I am more than satisfied with what the phone offers as I dont have to repeat what I have said to the person on the other end and I can also hear the other person clearly..  Storage: The new moto g comes with 16 gigs of storage and now comes with the ability to expand it via a micro sd card upto 32 gigs. Out of 16 gigs you get about 12-13 gigs of usable space. So I think all your storage needs are covered.  Battery life: Battery life is subjective and depends from person to person. The new moto g has the same battery as that of its predecessor. A non user replaceable 2070 mAh battery. Im a bit surprised that they havent bumped up the battery in proportion to the screen size. But nevertheless im able to squeeze out 7-8 hours of battery on an average with about 2-2.5 hrs of screen on time.  Display: The new moto g comes with a 5 inch HD (1280X720P) display. One thing that catches my attention is the incredibly thin bezels. Viewing angles are good, colour reproduction is decent. Watching movies and videos are a pleasure. The phone played almost any video I threw at it. Including a heavily encoded 1080p movie. Though you need to install a 3rd party video app called MX player from google play store.  Sound: The new moto g comes with dual front facing stereo speakers and man I must say its a pleasure to hear something play via the speakers. Though not like boom sound of HTC, I must say im more than happy with what motorola is offering. No problems with the ringer as well  Cons:  Camera: I think motorola have compromised on the camera, I have no qualms about colour reproductivity, contrast and so on. But the camera struggles to focus many times, very evident when you take close ups. I am coming from the nokia lumia 720 and I am already missing the fantastic camera that it had. The flash is also a disappointment, it doesnt light up the entire frame, the light tends to fade towards the corners of the frame.  Connectivity: The moto g comes with almost every connectivity option including bluetooth and wifi but alas! no NFC. NFC hasnt really picked up in India yet but its a matter of time before it does. I dont think many of you would think of this as a con but IMO this is some form of a compromise and I feel its a con.  So thats it guys. Hope you liked this honest review. Give me a thumbs up if you liked this review. Cheers!",2 of 2 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,Bang for Buck,"After using Moto G 2014 for the past week my personal opinion are as follows 1. The phone's display is one of its best asset. Its big and has good colour reproduction and the image quality is best for the price. 2. The Camera takes more than decent pics.Front camera has better details for selfies Enough details and good colours for casual photography 3. Video's are good with enough detail though 1080p would make customers more happy( Anyway shooting high quality videos isn't much of a necessity for most people, the default 720p is good enough for your casual functions) 4. Google now is flawless and phone catches your commands good enough. 5. Even though the phone has the same S400 chipset the performance is good enough with snappy performance for casual usage. High end and intensive gamers may be satisfied with screen size and performance but the phone would get heated soon. 6. The default headset is of good quality but its not in-ear and the design awkward. Better buy JBL in-ear headsets than stock 7. Charger is ok but it gets heated up and cools itself later so dont worry about it. 8. Use official micro sim rather than using a trimmed sim. My trimmed sim had connectivity issues 9. A guaranteed L update and a active development community support makes it a better option than most micromaxx, karbon phones (I personally dont prefer the indian branded china sets but its your wish) 10. The phone has 16GB internal out of which 11-12GB is usable and apps can be moved to SD too. Didn't check OTG.  So thats all about my experience with this wonderful budget smartphone. The Phone provides nexus performance and experience at a lower cost. Doesn't has fancy things, but doesn't upsets you much. Its the best ans sensible choice for a casual user on a normal budget",2 of 2 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,One of the greatest decisions that I have took.,"Friends, I am totally satisfied with this wonderful beast. Moto G (2nd Gen) is an excellent phone. One of the greatest bombs designed by my beloved Motorola gonna explode and repel samchung a.k.a Crapsung. I am amazed to see how can a company bring vividity to such an extent that it seems like I am using a device equipped with an amoled display. I think Motorola did proper SWOT Analysis before launching Moto G 2nd Generation, that is why there are no shortcomings. Let discuss its pros and cons.  Pros:- 1) I have never seen such vividness in an ips lcd display. 2) Colours are well saturated. 3) Other phones have dedicated app storage but there is no such partition for apps in internal memory, that means you can fully use the internal storage for apps installation i.e 12GB. 4) This mobile supports microsd slot. That means you can expand its memory as per your need. 5) I never thought that an android device would be able to stand against my Nokia N8 in terms of sound quality. Being an Audiophile I always try to use the device that can meet my expectations. And believe me it has passed the test by a huge margin.  6) Dual front speakers give you pleasant experience when you listen or watch any song in landscape mode. 7) Camera is excellent although not as good as my Nokia N8 but you will definately enjoy its camera quality. Although front camera is only 2mp still it is better than any other 5mp camera of companies like mmx. 8) Built quality is awesome, I'd say it is close to that of Nokia's built quality. 9) Corning's Gorilla Glass 3 makes the screen durable, although I didn't perform a drop test but I tried it scratching with knife, screw driver etc. but didn't able to scratch it. 10) Battery is decent, atleast I am satisfied with its performance. 11) No matter you are playing a hd game or a basic game, it won't heat-up a bit.  12) Touch is very smooth.  13) I have played almost every game on it and it was smooth all over thanks to its powerful cpu and gpu i.e Snapdragon 400 and Adreno 305.  Cons:  1) Stock earphones are not good, but it doesn't matter I use Sennheiser CX-180. 2) Charger is weak, it takes almost 3 hours to fully charge. But I use Digiflip 6600 mAH power bank to charge it, as it takes only 1.5 hours to charge my moto. 3) Pure Android UI is not so user friendly. But still I like it.  That's all for now. You can rely on my review. Unbiasness Guaranteed :)",2 of 2 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,Comprehensive Review of Moto G 2nd Gen,"I have been using the Moto G 2nd Gen for about a week now which, I believe, puts me in a good position to review the phone and talk about my overall experience with it.   Buying Experience:  The buying experience was smooth and hassle free. I ordered the phone minutes after it was launched and the site (Flipkart) didn't crash and had thankfully anticipated the demand enough that the phone didn't sell out within minutes! The delivery was done 2 days BEFORE the promised date so all in all, a great job by Flipkart!   First Impressions:  Unbox and you see this slab of glass, simple, sleek and beautiful! Hold the phone and the first thing you realize is that the phone has a very premium hand feel! The build quality is top notch and the design is simple, just how it should be! The sides have a piano black finish which does make the phone a little slippery while holding it. You also notice that the phone is quite big but holding it is comfortable thanks to that curved back and the matte finish of the back panel. The back is plastic but in no way does it feel cheap. You know you've got something that is worth the money that you paid for it!   Pros:   - If there was one feature that shines on the Moto G 2nd Gen, it has to be those front firing stereo speakers! I was blown away by the clarity of those little things! Definitely the best speakers I've heard on any phone!  - The 5 inch display is great! For watching videos or reading e-books, it seems to be just right.   - The 8 mp camera is decent. Does what it is told. The camera interface is also surprisingly simple. I am yet to try the camera in different light settings but indoor shots till now have been good enough. The video recording is 720p and can also be done in slow motion. You will enjoy making slow motion videos on the phone! You can also take photos WHILE recording the video. Something that I wasn't expecting to be honest!  - The phone is dual sim, very very useful for people who are always traveling between two cities! The call quality is crisp, noise cancellation is good.   - External storage via a microSD card is a major plus that the original Moto G lacked. Along with an SD card slot, the phone also gets USB OTG. So external pendrives can also be connected via an OTG cable. Very handy to carry all your data at all times.  - The battery lasts me 18 hours with normal usage, 2G internet, auto sync enabled and the screen brightness at 50%. If you use the 'battery saver' mode, the phone easily lasts a day on charge. No complaints there.   - The OS is the vanilla Android and it is slick with no lags whatsoever. The animations and transitions are smooth, multitasking is a breeze. The phone never seems to struggle even when playing graphics intensive games. Thanks to the stock Android, the phone will be one of the first phones to get the updates. That is a big plus!  - The Moto G 2nd Gen supports the ""Ok Google"" hot-word from any screen. Basically, once enabled, you can say ""Ok Google"" no matter what you are doing on the phone and Google search immediately comes up asking you what needs to be done. Very nifty and neat!  - The phone has a water resistant coating inside out. Full marks to Motorola!.   Cons:   - The phone charger! The phone charger is of a low output (550 mA) and because of that, charging the Moto takes a lot of time.  - Non removable battery. This can be a deal breaker for some people however I don't think much of it.  - No data cable in the retail box. You need to buy that separately if you don't already own one.  - The earphones that come out of the box are average in their audio output. People who take their music seriously will have to buy new earphones.   - No external camera button, something I miss coming from the Lumia family of phones.  - While not entirely a problem, operating the phone with one hand is usually not possible thanks to its increased size.   Competition:  In the mid level segment, the Moto G 2nd Gen reigns supreme! According to me, it is the best value for money phone in the market. Yes, the Chinese and Indian competitors are offering phones with bumped up specs at lesser price but none can match the Moto in terms of brand value and build quality. Add to that the offering of stock Android with a guaranteed update to Android L and the Moto G 2nd Gen becomes a very good deal!   A special mention of the Samsung Galaxy S5 Mini, a phone that offers almost the same specifications as the Moto G 2nd Gen BUT costs twice as much! What was Samsung thinking?  The Moto G 2nd Gen is everything that its predecessor was and then some more! The original Moto G was a brilliant device and the 2nd Gen continues that legacy.  If you are in the market on a budget, looking for a no nonsense phone, the Moto G 2nd Gen is your best bet!",2 of 2 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,Moto G,"Been using this phone for over a day now Pros:  1)Brilliant display 2)Awesome camera 3)Smooth Performance 4)Great value for money 5)Feels really good in your hand 6)Motorola Migrate got the phone ready to roll in 5 minutes from my old samsung. 7)SD card slot (upto 32 gb) 8) Even with a 5 inch screen, it isnt too big to handle. Just the right size.  Cons: I'll be nitpicking here coz there aren't many. :P  1)The front panel is both left right and top bottom symmetric and this happened to me more than 5 times in the last 24 hours: Phone lying on a surface face up. Picks it up and presses where the power button should be only to find it missing. Then realises that i'm holding the phone upside down. When I wanted to switch from landscape to portrait orientation and i flip the phone 90 degrees and display doesnt change. Took me a while to realise that I was again holding it upside down. This takes a bit getting used to. The only indication in the front panel is the front camera (which you may not notice if your phone is black) 2)No USB cable supplied.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,4 stars,A good phone which could have been better,"I have purchased both the versions of the Moto G on launch day. My previous phone was the Motorola Defy Plus bought 2 years ago. I bought the first gen phone for my wife. I got this for myself. Here's my views on the various aspects Form Factor: I prefer the form factor of the 1st gen Moto G as its easier to use single handed and more pocket friendly.  Display: The display of the 1st gen Moto G is brighter, has better sunlight legibility and has more saturated colours. The 2nd gen Moto G display is not as good as the 1st gen one.  Storage: The 2nd gen Moto G is better due to the microSD card slot. This is what prompted me to buy it. I had a few issues migrating data from my Defy Plus. The Migrate app copied all my media files to the internal storage of the Moto G. Then, the Storage setting ""Move media to SD card memory"" didn't move my videos to the SD card. I used ES File Explorer to move my videos from internal memory to the SD card.  Call Quality: Excellent as always with Motorola phones.  General Usage: Smooth like before due to stock Android. I'm not a heavy multi-tasker and 1 GB RAM still seems enough for me.  Media Consumption: Watching videos and playing games is better on the 2nd gen Moto G due to the bigger screen. Audio quality is good but I'm surprised that PowerAmp sounded better on my Defy Plus. The bundled music player sounds better than PowerAmp on the Moto G. I'm not sold on the stereo speaker functionality in the new Moto G. I think the 2 silver bars just spoil its looks and don't sound as loud in a noisy environment.  Camera: The cameras in the 2nd gen Moto G have been upgraded from the 1st gen one. I haven't extensively tested the camera - its a feature I don't use much. It looks OK to me but I wouldn't be surprised if its not as good as the competition. Motorola has always lagged in the camera department.  Battery Life: The 2nd gen Moto G keeps the same battery as the 1st gen one after increasing the screen size. So, the battery life is not so good, just average.  Charger: Motorola still bundles the same bakwas charger in the new Moto G. No USB cable, only 550mA charging rate. I still use my Defy Plus charger which is much better - has a detachable USB cable and 850mA charging rate.  In summary, providing expandable memory on the new Moto G was a good move. However, they should have at least put a bigger battery and bundled a decent charger with a detachable USB cable. I would rate it 3.5/5 but I'm rounding it to 4.",2 of 2 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,4 stars,Why not to buy Xiaomi Redmi 1S and prefer Moto G,"1> Motorola has the reputation and now its backed by Google. 2> Xiaomi is completely Chinese, they are giving away these low cost mi devices to snoop data,  if you do not believe it.. google this.. you will know how xiaomi is stealing user data. Indian government is not realizing this yet.. from huawei to zte to xiaomi all steal data..  for more information lets compare SOC used by Xiaomi Redmi 1S and Moto G (both versions)  Redmi1S has 1.6 GHz MSM8228, Quad Core for Indian version which has HSUPA (3G data.. fast for uploading your data) Where as Moto G has 1.2 Ghz Qualcomm Snapdragon 400, Quad Core has HSDPA (3G for faster data downloading)  Rest its upto you guys...

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,Good value for money Impressive Smartphone,"If you are looking for a good value for money smartphone that does not skimp on features you are looking at the right phone in the 2nd Generation Avatar of Moto G. As usual ordering and delivery from Flipkart was convenient and super fast. Ordered at 10:45am received at 4:00pm.  Coming to the phone itself, the package ships with wired headset(earplug+mic) and a charger with a detachable micro USB cable. Unlike the reviews read online for units sold in Europe, the unit in India ships with Charger and wired headset. Its too early to comment on battery life and charger performance.  Screen is bright and clear - 5"" size is convenient to use as a phone and for internet usage. Inclusion of a microSD card slot is an added advantage over the previous version. The call quality in my limited use till now since laying hands on the phone has been pleasing and very good. The speaker performance is also good. The unit supports dual sim and takes micro SIMs. I have set up SIM1 for my official sim and SIM2 for my personal number and data usage. On the first boot, the unit prompts you asking which of the SIMs you wish to setup for data/interconnect. Yet to test out the camera - but given that its an improvement in specifications over the previous 1st gen Moto G, i expect the camera performance to be good as well. Supports 3G - LTE support is still missing in this version.   The back side of the phone has kind of smooth matte like finish - its not glossy. Further its not fully flat, but slightly curved at backside. Holding it is comfortable. I felt the phone feels slightly heavy in comparison to having held the Nexus 5, Galaxy Note kind of phones.  None of the accessories were available at the time of ordering. So the the big sales pitch of 50% off on accessories on the 1st day of ordering was no help.   Could not notice any annoying cons till now. Shall update this review after a few days of usage. Overall an excellent value for money budget phone that does not skimp on features. So far well pleased with what I paid for.",2 of 2 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,4 stars,Could have been BETTER !!,"Ordered a new moto g 2nd gen at 12.00 am when the sale began. Was very exited to get the phone.. I have the moto g(1st gen) as well.  1) After i received the the new phone i unboxed it and the 1st thing i did was to switch on the phone.. i noticed that the power & volume buttons were not up to the mark in terms of build quality when compared to the earlier moto g that i have.  2)After the phone was booted the phone seemed fine in terms of display. But in comparison with the earlier moto g, i played a same HD video on both phones simultaneously. As expected the video, the video quality on the moto g2 was not great due to the resolution of this phone.. The viewing angles on the earlier moto g was very good due to its higher ppi..!! The color contrast on the new moto g is not as good as the earlier moto g as well.  3)The 3rd point that i noticed on the new moto g2(2nd gen) was, when i put both the phones (both moto g & g2) on AUTO brightness mode the new phone's screen looked very dull in comparison with the moto g. The earlier moto g is very bright and crisp.  4)The new moto g2 feels really good to hold in hand and feels lighter but its actually little heavier than the old one.  5)The camera is pretty good on the g2. The flash on the older moto g was lot brighter than the new one..  6)Sound quality is pretty good on the moto g than the g2.  7)The SD card slot is a major advantage in the g2. After using it for couple of days its showing SD card damaged. The camera and gallery did not open itself when i had put the SD card.. Dont know if the device that I have has an issue or all of them r facing the same issue. I switched off the phone, put the sd card again n rebooted it. It worked fine. There is some issue with the SD card slot.. Needs a fix !!  Overall it a pretty ok phone for 13k but could have been a lot better in terms of the hardware specs..!!

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,Totally satisfied with replacement MOTO G (2nd gen),"The phone looks good and fine to hold. But I found a lot of major issues with my phone. 1. the phone speaker was crackling , even for simple moto notification ringtone. 2.when you recieve a call , the phone ringtone is heard after a long delay of say 10 secs. 3. while charging , the notification LED does not come ON. Nor when charge complete. 4. charger supplied is very poor quality , only 550mA. Takes long time to charge. This phone requires minimum 1 A charger. 5.Phone looks very symmetric , so somtimes you end up holding it upside down when you get a call . there should have been a MOTO name on top.  display looks OK and No lag.Battery life was good. overall a good phone ,but dejected with sound quality, which is like that of chinese phones. Asked for a replacement 4 days back, but still no response from flipkart. Looks like they have recived lots of complaints regarding this cell , and waiting for update from MOTOROLA company.  The REPLACEMENT phone has an excellant and crisp display. earlier one had a bit dull display. The led notification issue while charging is still there , may be its the same in all the phones. DESPITE being an HTC ONE X+ user , I am totally satisfied with this phone and its high quality. Overall a must buy .

Out of the box, this device looks stunning,with the little upgrade from the previous version.they have compromised some PPI count,but is not the big deal at all.it looks same and sharp. Device fits nicely in the hands, comfortable to use it with single hand.Kitkat works smooth on the s400..nearly an year old chip set.  one notable upgrade is the front facing speakers.Its not only loud but the sound quality is very much improved. next about the interface,Am not the lover of stock android,but 4.4 is smooth and stable.am happy that it can be customized to more user friendly.But I still miss my HTC sense experience which is more user friendly than the stock. Its good to have dual sim support, but as of my experience it takes more time for the device to recognize both the sim cards.For a moment I thought it was a problem but it is not. Am yet to test the device performance on gaming and heavy usage,but I believe it wont disappoint me as the original Moto G performed really well. And the next big thing camera.. Moto has added an 8 MP shooter with this,and its a good upgrade from the original one,it takes some nice snaps.Cam quality is better than some old flagships with 8MP shooter.am very much satisfied with the shooter. one notable thing with the shooter is that its bit faster than the old one,and touch to snap is very handy.selfy cam is also good. Battery   am bit disappointed that no upgrade to the battery.Am sure this phone will not perform as good as the previous one as the screen size increased and the port for SD is included.but it will last for a day with normal usage. Moto offers a Charger and the ear piece with this phone,but they are not as classy as the phone charger cable cant be separated,and the headphone performs really poor.  Most users have a confusion whether to buy Moto or MI3. It depends on what you expect from the phone. but Keep one thing in mind ""MOTO g is a mid range phone with the flagship Quality and MI3 is flagship with mid range quality."" although MI3 has a greater chip-set it feels cheap in hands.I have used both the devices,Moto G feels like holding a flagship,and in case of MI3 i felt like holding a Casio calculator. MI3 is good on paper.but Moto feels much better in hands. MI3 has almost double the amount of pixels than of MOTO but still moto G beats it comfortably.remember MOTO is only 720p.its far better than the Chinese.  ""If you need an uncompromisable daily driver then its good to buy MOTO G. if u believe in paper specs, you can go for the Chinese.""",4 of 6 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Full Battery charge, is not giving more than 3.5 hrs. 2. Phone is getting heated up in wrist while talking.  Complained to FK on the same, by pressing return button two times on website.   They closed two tickets. By giving instructions of some exercise.  Did the same as instructed, but there is no improvement in the mobile phone's behavior.  Learned 3 things by spending 12999 on FK!  One, Flipkart will not replace your phone, even if it is defective. Two, They are interested in closing Tickets not on the problem solving. Three, spending 5 digits of money on FK will never get back!!

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,Ji Ji its Moto G......,"Its time for new moto g & it did not disappoint me.  Have been using it for last 9 days & i am writing down what i felt when used this phone.  Moto g comes with pretty clean & simple package & not to forget no USB cable & if ur first to android devices u might get disappointed for not having a cable.   The design of the moto is very elegant & it comes with a screen guard on the phone so no need to buy one. Display is pretty sharp & crisp & viewing angels are also pretty good. Processor works pretty fast on 3g or wifi with no lags whatsoever after updating all the preinstalled apps & downloading lot of apps.   It's almost stock android & 4.4.4 kitkat out of the box comes with some cool apps like photos, newsstand, (to name a few) not to forget the Ui is simple & clean which I loved. Chrome is the default browser & works brilliantly & the new UI of chrome is also interesting.  As usual it comes with moto apps like alert, migrate, assist all does the job as said. I am not a gaming person so i am not going to say anything about it since i havn't played any games, but i believe snapdragon 400 can handle all the games designed for it.   Call quality, is also very good (both loud speaker & microphone) without any problem one can hear the voice of other person.  Motorola has supplied a very average headset, infact its below average. My old phone Galaxy s lcd had better headset undoubtedly. Most of the customers would be disappointed with this quality of headset. Quality of audio is very less & sometimes i find it difficult to realise which song is playing while I am riding on my two wheeler. But moto backs it up by beautiful front stereo speakers, they are absolutely brilliant & enjoyed every bit of it.  Yes charger do get heated up a bit but folks if u had used samsung phones previously use samsung charger to charge the moto I have personally checked the capacity of both samsung & moto charger & both supply same amount of power or less (in case of samsung) u can check the spcifications on ur chargers. & guess what phone doesn't get heated up when charged by samsung charger. I have been doing it from last 9 days.  Battery is pretty decent & it comes for a whole day with normal usage. I get a back up of almost a day which is fine for me. however one can change thier runtime from dalvik to ART in developer options for better battery response.  Dual sim for those who love to have two sims & both work pretty well, signal strength is also very good. It also comes with the micro sd slot so more soace for heavy storage.  Camera also works very well both rear & front camera photos looked much better in non HDR mode (personal preference) It also supports 720p video recording & it also boosts slow motion video 2 720p which is quiet awesome.  Overall I really like the new moto g & i have enjoyed every bit of it.",2 of 3 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,"Myself-MOTO G, MOM- MOTO E, BRO- THE MOTO G(2nd Gen). Was stunned with New Moto-G !!","The moment i opened the box i felt i was holding a very premium phone which might be costing around 25k-30k. I had that feel in my hand. The phone is super awesome as the moto-g(1st Gen) and the cam quality had been increased a lot and thats a very good job done in this phone. I have purchased a moto-g for myself and a moto-e for my mom and now i have purchased this new edition for my bro. Now my whole family is holding moto devices. We are all very happy using the device. I have been using my moto-g from 9 months( i have purchased the global gsm version in US) and seriously there wasnt even a small glitch and the same from moto-e from 4 months and same continues with the new moto-g i hope so. Regarding the specs i dont need to say much everything is perfectly blend for this price range and handset. May be there might be companies offering you other features or increased capabilty but i am sure that for the price we paid this moto-g lasts long than other devices.. People who want quality , performance , proper service, battery life, connectivity and pure android experience this is the best buy at this price range. Flipkart u always make me happy. Ordered at 9:32 AM on 6th sept got it delivered by 6:20PM on 7th sept with no extra cost( BGLR-HYD). Kudos to flipkart.  The only problem is the cost of the back panels. If they are reduced to a large extent then many would opt buying original shells or cases.",2 of 3 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,4 stars,"Go For It ....Moto G2...Smart,Fast and a Looker","Here is my Review covering the entire exp of buying and using it- trying to be non partial and practical.  1) Service/Delivery- Booked it in Midnight, delivered at 3pm next day, but m pissed with FLIPKART and thus had a long Mail chain of complain back and forth regarding the issue that they (EKART) do not provide the info of courier person who will deliver the product. I ask you guys, do you want to stay all day in home just becoz of a courier that too on a sunday, well you have too coz there is no phone number of EKART on internet and flipkart says thay dont have it either.  2) MOTO G2 Packaging- Very very simple,looks like a budget cut in the box.  NO USB Cable- so they are assuming you already have one .!!!! (-0.5) Headphone looks very avg so i did not even bothered to try them out.  3) DESIGN- 5 star no doubt about it, the phone as soon as i took out of the box fell in love with it. M using nexus 4 right now, and this phone is so light and feels safer in hand, the back panel (white) is rubber type material which is good, will avoid finger print marks. although the weight is also an issue coz at times i felt like its a TOY rather than a phone.   4) Display- same a prev moto G. I am happy with the display with the amount of money i paid  5) Storage- 5 star for adding External storage. 32GB   6) Camera - Disappointed, 8MP, u kidding me. My very OLD Samsung S2 took amazing pics with 8MP. its more of a 3mp camera.  The images are whitish and washed out. the front cam is even worse. could have been way better.  7) BATTERY- charging is looking slow to me, will wait and watch how it goes.   8) Performance - Its Stock android and with Quad core 400 chip, its working better than i expected. no lag, and very smooth . though i dont like the 4.4 icon in app drawer. looks to big   9) Sound- Sound are really good, front facing dual speaker are just very well tuned.  10) call reception- its funny that people now talk and concern about call quality in the end, well my first call came from home, and mothers voice always sound great. call quality is really good :)  11) Net speed: Slow on wifi , will have to check how 3G works.  12) RESULT : 4 start out of 5 and +0.5 for the awesome back panel curve design. For me looks matter 70% in a phone and 30% specs. so Thums up for Moto G.  Surely it do not match with 14000 xiomi mi3, but i did not like that phone design and its stupid to first register than wait and try to book at 2pm...its just crappy process. its just a phone not my life,,so will pass mi2 for now,,,  hope you guys find it useful.",2 of 3 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,hats off to Moto,"First thing first....  Ordered the phone in night @ 2 AM with standard delivery mode... had the phone in my hand 8 hours later by 10 AM....so 5 stars to Flipkart.....  Now about the phone..... At this price range, MotoG2 has intense competition. I myself searched through an amazing range of choices, but in the end decided for MotoG2 for the simple reason that the quality does matter over specs.... The phone definitely looses out to competition on the point of lesser ram, older processor, lesser PPI and smaller battery capacity.... but it all becomes meaningless as soon as you start the phone... Its a fab product with no lag, very easy to use... simple, clean and very functional interface both physical and software wise... battery life has been good so far.... camera does its job nice but could definitely have been better..... I have been a very heavy and advanced user of phones (some of them have been of the highest specs) and now all I want from my phone is to have a responsive, functional and usable experience with a good camera and good battery while not burning my purse... in that respect, nobody can beat this phone at this price..... would highly recommend this phone if that's wat you are looking for.....",2 of 3 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

The legacy continues..,"After using the moto g (2d gen) for 1 month and other handsets(given below) for some time, I must say Moto G (2nd gen) keeps upto the legacy of its previous version.  Pros: Build quality is top notch.(after hand-on comparison with Asus zenfone 5, zenfone 6 , htc desire 816, redmi 1 s, moto g (gen 1), samsung S3 neo, Nokia lumia 525, 730) Best battery backup (non removable ) Timely updates Fits your hand perfectly (although gen 1 is better) Responsive (htc 816 is better) Brilliant and Vivid display (gen 1 has much better ppi) Value for money considering long term use. (Asus phones wont last long) Front facing camera is good (816 has better camera) Micro sd card slot (prev gen lacked this feature) Improved call and sound quality (compared to prev version) Splash proof coating  Cons: A little bit sluggish after lollipop update Primary Camera not good in low light Earphone Sound quality is still just average compared to competitors. Little bit bulky and heavy compared to competitors.   NB: Use armor case for better protection since replacement displays can cost upto 7k.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,1 star,Moto G 2nd Gen rocks.. Flipkart service is pathetic,"5 stars for Moto G 2nd gen. This is about flipkart service. I even doubt if they vl post this review.   Ordered Moto G on Jan 20th under In a day guarantee as I am a flipkart first customer & payment was done through EMI option & there was a discount of rs.1300 on my card. 2 hours later I wanted to change the address & called customer care regarding this. They said they cannot deliver under in a day and said it would be normal dlivery process as the pincode is not covered under in a aday delivery. I agreed for that. On 21st they cancelled my order without my consent & sent a mail saying their courier partner cannot deliver. Problems started after this as 21 was the billing date of my credit card. As it was purchased under EMI I had no option to cancel the EMI.   In the meantime the order was cancelled 4 times, cancellation was cancelled twice, refund done twice. Finally received the item on 30th Jan.   Flipkart customer care(care?? do they really?) is really disgusting and annoying. they told so many lies. They told they vl speak to bank n cancel the EMI n refund the money to my card!! N some one said the product is out of stock n negotiations are goin on with WS retail to get it in stock!! About delivery dates they gave, less said the better. All they vl do is try to convince the customer by tellin cock n bull(shit) stories n say they have forwarded it to the concerned department which is dead I guess as nothing ever happened. Even they went to the extent of asking me to pay the EMI irrespective of the delivery of the product!!  Beware guys. Dont fall for the nice words n false promises. They dont give a shit about customers. Once your money is with them u r screwed. They wont even respond to your mails. They wont commit to delivery dates by sending any mail. They vl just say it verbally. If u cal them thn they vl convince u. Thats it. They wont solve ur problem. They never bother abt customers. So I advice u to demand a mail for thr commitments n do not disconnect the cal unless u get a mail from them.   Flipkart learn some ethics. You are here coz of the customers. Stop fooling them. I am really disappointed for being a Flipkart First customer by paying Rs.500. Your customer care is so so annoying and disappointing. Not at all service oriented. Just tryin to convince the customer for the blunders u make.",1 of 1 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,4 stars,Definetly a good buy,"I ordered moto g2 on 30th jan and it was delivered on 3rd feb. so, yeah flipkart has nice delivery, while others are not as fast as this one. Now come to the phone,  1st I like to say abt its design.fantastic form factor. It fits easily in hands even it has 5 inch display. Motorola designed it very nicely. Two front speakers are loud enough but not expect too much( it's not a chinese phone :P). Back cover is rubberised and not slippery at all, edges are curved and smooth and grip is tight. It is only a little bigger than my lumia 720.So don't think it is very big phone and it'll not fit in your pocket.  2nd come to the OS, when it was delivered, first thing I did that I upgraded it to lollipop. but honestly it is not good as compare to kitkat. I've used kitkat in micromax canvas A1 and that was really good one.Yeah lollipop has some animations and good interface than kitkat but in some aspect like menu and search engine goes white which I don't like. there's lot of problem in network connectivity which is very slow to connect and in my phone it doesn't show H+ only H or E. It is not very big problem but sometimes you cannot judge the exact spped of the network.  3rd is about perfomance. I strictly don't advice this one for heavy gamers. I played riptide gp2, contract killer, aspalt 8 and dead trigger. I found these games little laggy when compared to my canvas A1 which is very smooth compared to moto g2 in gaming performance. If you are not intersted in big games or if subaway surfer temple run are enough for you then you won't found any problem. Otherwise phone is very smooth and touch is too.  4th is display. No match in this range. Colourful, natural and Crisp, Not like samsung phones which has over saturated display.touch is very responsive and buttery smooth.  5th is camera. Don't except too much. I've lumia 720 which has 6.7 MP camera but far better than moto g2's 8 MP. but I don't want to say G2's camera is bad. if u want a camera phone go for lumia 730, you'll get better camera performance and camera app too and if you are not intersted in windows what can I say. :p  6th now come to the battery performance. Not bad at all. just turn off the mobile data when you're not using it. you'll get full day backup. In mix usage like net surfing and gaming I've no problem in battery backup. It's sufficient for an android phone which has 5 inch display so don't think childish like It has to give 2-3 day backup and bla bla.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,1 star,Flipkart conning people in name of offers.,"First all nice mobile phone. Really great value for money.   When I bought the phone, as per Flipkart's ""Offer"" I was supposed to get 1GB of 3G data on my Airtel number. I bought the phone on 31st which was the last day of the offer. I never got any free data.  Flipkart support said issue will be resolved by 4th Feb. This morning got a text saying I will get the offer by 1pm. Another text comes in saying issue will be resolved by 5th Feb 8pm. And now a Support person called in telling the issue will take another 3-4 days to get resolved.  Dear Flipkart, If you can't manage or provide with the offers, stop displaying them on your website. The offer is still shown on the page. But under terms it says valid till 31st Jan. If the offer is expired why still showing on the page.",1 of 1 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,"I don't know The Best Phone in The World, yet, until now , it is the best for me","Let me start from beginning, i searched about buying a new phone in December and i ended up on Motorola Moto G 2nd gen and i received it on 13th December after 9 days of placing the order. It was smooth even earlier before Lollipop upgrade, but now, it is on the TOP, the creamy texture and smooth OS made it even better. And after using it for 1 month and 18 days i have become a fan of Motorola and not to forget Flipkart and it's costumer service. My Next Phone would surely be a Motorola phone and it would be definitely from Flipkart.  Pros- *Touch *Expandable Memory  *Speaker *Lollipop  *Camera *Mics etc.  Cons- If you have heard that it's battery doesn't last much, than here i am telling you that its battery lasts for ages if YOU DON'T USE IT, haha Definitely, if you use it the battery gonna drain, yet it have one day battery backup and new lollipop feature tells you how many hours(approx) your device can run.  Don't hesitate, Go For it. It is an awesome phone under 20k. it's competition is with Moto x 2nd 33k.",1 of 1 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,4 stars,Reasonable phone at reasonable price - Now with Android Lollipop update,"Latest Update first - Got Android Lollipop (v5.0.2) update today morning (29-Jan-15). It came pre-loaded with Android Kitkat. There are several visible changes with Lollipop that require a few minutes of unlearning and learning. The update was very big though (around 360-370 MB). Fortunately, the phone is still working fine after the update :-)  I purchased the phone under exchange scheme last week. Also got 10% cashback for credit card. Overall, was a good deal (though I still mourn my Huawei Ascend G510) for around 10K.  Prior to owning this phone, my previous phones had slower processors and 512 or lesser RAM. This phone has slightly better processor and around 850-900 MB RAM (couldn't determine exact RAM because it shows values between 850 to 880 MB, and Motorola claims 1 GB of RAM). Despite this difference between actual and claimed RAM, there is no lag while doing usual operations on phone.   One thing that I liked about this phone is that it doesn't get heated while charging or while using Wi-Fi or playing games (my previous phones suffered from this problem).  Camera quality is good though I noticed minor lag in adjusting focus.  One can argue about getting a plain-vanilla phone (Moto G) at a higher price than some fancy phone like Redmi Note or 1S (both with better specs on paper). I feel it is better to stick to a well-known brand. I have heard a couple of negative comments about Service Centers of Motorola, but I have not yet experienced them myself.  One major negative for this phone is the absence of USB data cable. The charger has fixed wires (unlike other phones where charger cable doubles up as data cable). I believe it doesn't cost much for Motorola to include a USB data cable.  About Flipkart's delivery - while these guys are really fast in delivering the items, they don't send proper info on SMS (to reschedule delivery or to enquire more). I got an SMS a day after ordering the phone and the delivery guy was already at my doorstep. Since I was at work, he returned later evening to deliver. It would have been better if Flipkart had sent me Cellphone number of delivery boy or he would have called me prior to visiting my home.",1 of 1 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

But do we wonder how is it possible for then to offer such configuration at this price!! They ll have to cut corners somewhere right ? Well its customer service and supply chain management where they are saving big time.   My Moto g2's screen developed a problem due to which it needed to be replaced. Gave it to service centre. Its been one month and still my phone is with them!!!  That is worst type of service, compared no Samsung and Nokia I would say this is nothing. I once got my Nokia 520's screen changed over the counter, they did not even ask me to come after some time.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,1 star,Beware of Motorola products,"I bought a Moto G from Flipkart on 14 December 2014. The experience was good and I thought I had bought myself a great product. However, my Moto G phone just ""died"" yesterday - within 45 days of purchase. No amount of charging or pressing multiple keys as suggested by their site helped. I took it to a Motorola Service Center at Andheri, Mumbai and was shocked to learn that the motherboard has failed in such a new phone. Further, I was informed that the spare will be available after 15-20 days! Hello Moto! Which world are we living in? Does Motorola expect that I have multiple phones - hence, this phone is so un-important in my life that I can wait for 3 weeks?   Why is Motorola selling these phones aggressively on Flipkart when they cannot ensure basic build quality or reasonable service support?  I asked for a process of refund and as I expected, the refund claim can be made only within 30 days. Hence, now I am stuck with this sad phone and pathetic service for the rest of the life of this phone.

I felt for the price range this was the best that was offered and went for it. Was completely satisfied for first two months. As i starting clicking more pictures and loading more songs the phone started to become slow, slower day by day and two days back it kept restarting for sometime and then refused to turn on. I still have no luck with it. The phone just wont turn on.  I called up the Flipkart customer care and was told that only for the 1st month they are responsible and after that any issue that occurs would be handled by the Motorola service center. I am yet to take my phone there.   I dint expect a 13k worth phone to work for 3 months and stop and refuse to even start. This was a big disappointment for me, i have bought several things online but i guess buying electronics online is a bad decision, atleast for me.  The phone is really good look wise and for the price, i feel the camera did a fab job too, no complaints about the audio part as well. But all this for 3 months only? Thats my concern here.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,Good and probably the most sturdy and reliable phone,"I am writing this review after using the phone for 2 months:  Design: Looks very premium, probably a metal strip would have enhanced the look. But the feel of the product is very good and it sits anywhere very comfortably, whether in your palm, pocket, or in the provided space in the car. The rubbery effect of the back cover prevents it from slipping away from hand.  Display: Not the greatest, especially in the outdoors. But do we necessarily look at the screen in bright sunlight. Probably if we are looking at the screen 30 times a day during receiving a call, only 5 will be in the bright sunlight. But the display handles the broad daylight well, although it does not shine admirably.  Built: Very strongly built. I have a feeling that even if it slips away and falls with a thud, it wount break into pieces. In fact the built has a certain shock absorbing quality, which makes it one of the most strong products in the market. The next stronger phone would be a land line handset.  Software and UI: It is a pure Android Kit Kat latest version phone. So there is nothing to talk about. My advice to the users will be not to download loads of unnecessary software from the play store, which you will rarely use. This will prevent the phone from slowing down. A phone is like any other machine. Overloading will always stress any phone system and the system may fail, whether it is the most expensive phone or the cheapest. And after all , we don't buy a phone and then test its durability and smartness by overloading it with tasks. Multitasking is a word coined by the marketing people and people who write dictionaries. For a phone, its not a necessary function. Its just there so that only a few of us, who cannot finish our tasks, can do multitasking.   Call quality: Excellent. But sometimes it is just not there. There is silence. I am yet to understand whether it is because of the phone, or the network. My bet would be it is due to network   Connections: I use 3G continuously. The connection is fast, even at very remote areas as far as far flung villages of Assam, I got top connection. But again, that could be due to good network, combined with a good grip of the phone over that network. Blue tooth, WiFi, all work perfectly well  Battery: The most important aspect of a smartphone nowadays is its battery. I use another phone with over 4000mah battery. It never sleeps. It keeps going. But It cannot perform like Moto G. Moto G's performance, in respect of the battery that it uses, it nearly enough. But instead of the resent 2010 battery, Moto G could have put a 2500 battery.  But there are ways you can increase the life of the battery of Moto G. Log off from all unnecessary prgrammes, which you dont need 24 hours to run, like facebook, instagram, twitter etc. Switch off location service. Dont go to known places with the Google Map on. Do not navigate to a place which you already know.   If you do all these , you will be able to talk, sms and WhatsApp as much as possible, including keep your email services running. You may increase the sync period of the emails tough. It will save a little more of your battery.   With these, and not harming any of my business activity by logging off from unnecessary synching, I use the phone from early morning till 10.30 in the night. Go to sleep after that.  MOST IMPORTANT: Reliability. Many do not look for this. But my advice to you would be to look for extreme reliability of a product and the manufacturer's company background in terms of customer service. Motorola love themselves. And they will not let you down on the reliability factor. So if you have not yet bought this Moto G, Go for it. You will be a very happy phone user.",1 of 1 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,4 stars,Good budget phone but with some issues related to multitasking and battery drainage,"I had a moto g 1st generation which was a very good phone apart from its multitasking ability. Because of its 1 gb ram and not so great RAM management, it was very aggressive in killing the background applications. Sometimes it used to happen that I am making some payment through the chrome browser and when I switch to messaging app to see the OTP password and then switch back to Chrome, the payment page used to get refreshed and the whole thing had to be repeated again. It was frustrating. Recently I had bought Moto G 2nd generation and the same multitasking problem is present in this phone as well (as the RAM and RAM management is same as the 1st generation).  Another major issue I have found with 2nd generation which was not present in the earlier version is its battery life. The phone drains quite a lot of battery power even when it is idle. On checking which apps are draining the battery, I found that Cell Standby is taking lot of juice out of it (next to Screen - which obviously is the top battery consumer). So when you take your phone in the morning you will find that the battery is several notches down from what you left it in the night.This drainage issue was not there in the 1st gen. I think, there is some software issue related to this and if Motorola is listening (as it has been highlighted by many users in the official Motorola forums) then it should be rectified in the next software update. All said and done, the phone can still manage to get you through a normal day of usage.  So all in all, Moto G 2nd gen still remains the best phone to buy in this budget with some issues related to multitasking ability and battery life. No other complaints till now even after using the Moto G for more than 10 months (1st and 2nd gen combined)",1 of 1 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

I brought it from flipkart on 5/10/2014 and On 29/12/2014 my mobile is dead.   Worst products from Motorola don't even buy it. For this we can buy at least micromax.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,Moto G2- Compared Vs Zenfone 5 Vs Lumia 730,"I am comparing Moto G2 Vs Zen fone 5 Vs Lumia 730  These are the Mobile I was deeply done a research & Finally got the Moto G2. Note: Asus Zenfone 5 is already gave Gift to My wife. So I am user of both Mobs.  Review now: Pro Vs Zen 5 Vs Lumia 730: ================== 1. Handy Mob while Comparing to zenfone 5. zen 5 is bigger & quiet tough to chat. 2. Cam is better then Zen 5 when we use Flash. Zen 5 will give dull white shaded while flash. 3.Sound is crispy & good in Moto G2. 4.OTG is given . So we can use External USB for seeing movies. not in Lumia. 5.Windows Apps are not fast & not Better UI. When we see Fb messenger, Naukri etc 6.Caller Voice is Sleek & Accurate. Zen 5 has issues. It cant be heard when we travel in train or Bus.  Cons: ==== 1. Charging Take nearly 1: 15 hours to get completed. This is the problem in all the Android. Lumia 730 is fast 2. Net Speed is not fast when we use 2G Monthly Data Packs when compared to Lumia. But without any good Apps UI, fast cant be benefit to you in windows. 3.No separate USB Cable.  Note: ==== Review is based on 1 week usage of Moto g2 & 6 months usage of Zen 5 & 1 yr usage of Lumia (520).",1 of 1 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,1 star,Pathetic phone and pathetic service to compliment the product. Don't buy.,"I bought this phone a month ago. A couple of drops accidentally went in through the back panel as it was raining. The phone switched off instantly. A phone that can't withstand a couple of drops is totally useless. When I went to the Moto Service center, they were totally not interested in looking at the product and said that they charge 450 bucks just to look into the damage. This is really pathetic and unacceptable. In this day and age, Micromax and Xolo have better phones, and they provide better service. Flipkart are not willing to help me. The phone is useless. They are cheating people, and flipkart is not doing anything about it.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,3 stars,I sold it for 12k .This mobile is Not at all for heavy users.,"Moto G2 a good buy for starters not for heavy users like me. Wanted to purchase Moto X 1st gen,due to non availability I bought this.Now repenting for it. No refund policy from flipkart which is annoying.  Pros: Front Speaker quality is good..  One hand operation is possible ..  Cons: Not a heavy gamer. Asphalt 8 crashed few times, but hey not every time.It is strange that 1 gb is not enough for android phones.   Not a good multitask mobile.  Battery life is not good(6-8 hrs max). Disable Location to save battery is quite a annoying thing in every Android phones.   Takes more time to charge. U have to spend little more money to purchase 1 mah charger.   Basically stock android , sometimes I feel am I using Micromax series mobile.   Performance is below par. Touch sensitivity is not great. No 3rd party theme work good on it .Better to use stock android itself. Go for Zenfone if u need classic look smooth UI.  I think in coming days even 3 gb RAM might not be enough for android phone. Strange it is.   Final words: Below 15k this is ok.for starters since it is from Google ,android OS updates for sure.Buy Power bank along with this phone.People who look for performance based this is not the mobile for you.",1 of 1 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,4 stars,Extremely well balanced phone,"With the Samsungs and Apples in market, buying phone was costlier than buying a 2 wheeler with shelf life of 1-2 years. Here comes Moto G (first incarnation) which changed the perception of smart phones in terms of value offering at competitive prices.  About Moto G (2nd Gen) It is a well balanced phone with 5"" screen and stock Android OS, latter helps the user get the best of each new OS that Android launches (at times with its share of bugs as well..), this is something Samsung users can only dream after paying 3 times the money. 1 GB RAM does much more than actually required and thanks to stock OS, it works ore efficiently. Camera 8MP does its job extremely well in day light and with HDR mode defaulted, you can be guaranteed with good pictures. Its equally poor at dusk and low light conditions. Build quality is very sturdy with metal frame body giving it a tough feel.   Cons: a) Feels slightly bulky when compared with other phones but no deal breaker b) Curved back panel makes it little inconvenient while using. Extra back cover solves the issue c) Charger & ear phones are massive disappointments. Charging cable is not detachable and hence one needs a separate cable to connect the device with laptop.   Flipkart keeps continuing its great show of rapid quick delivery and customer focused service. Got a good deal at INR 9000 after exchanging my good old BB Curve 9300.",1 of 1 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,Think Twice!!,"Let me not negate the overall product as it is one of the best phones that you can buy at this budget with guaranteed android updates!  This review is particular to the unit I have got from Flipkart.   Firstly, I am completely dissapointed with the quality of the latest lot of Moto G2's that are being sold. I purchased this devices on 14th Dec 14 and the issues that I am facing with the product are:  1. There is a slight dent on the left hand side of the phone from day one. Immediately bought a cover from Flipkart itself and started using the same.   2. Phone started lagging a lot and I reset the phone. Still occasional lags can be seen.  3. Battery sucks big time on this particular device. Have to charge atleast 3 times a day with only mail and call usage. My previous Moto G's (have had 3 before) gave me a day's battery life.   4. Occasional heating of the phone.   5. Display quality is worse than previous Moto G 2014's.   I had raised a replacement request with Flipkart on 19th Dec 14 and they assured they will call me on 19th Dec itself. No call but I received SMS that they tried reaching me. All lies. I was in network full day and didn't receive any calls.   A call to customer care has assured me of a call today. No calls yet. Bad service FLIPKART to your Flipkart First Subscriber. Check my records and you will find my shopping history with you.   Hence, think twice before you purchase this device, specially the new lot. Check for dents on the metal part right at the beginning.   Update: FlipKart called up and did what was needful. Thanks FLIPKART!!!",1 of 1 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,4 stars,True Moto G review from an Android Developer,"got this phone 1 week back ago for Developing n Testing Apps since it has got Stock Android and quicker updates may receive update ASAP . well at first the benchmarks score were pretty good, phone is extremely good at these  1.Camera : since it has got 8 mp picture quality is super fine, dont use the zooming feature it sucks n the Front cam is too good in day light , tried making video calls on skype,viber etc Slow Motion Video is a better move dont expect miracles .   2.Performance : i have installed more than 90 apps none moved to sd card memory, checked with the multitasking none of them crashed if u use 4 apps consistently  the since the Stock android consumes less Ram I hardly get 350-200 mb free so, i rooted moto g managed to get 500 mb removed the moto g apps such as assist,alert etc these apps were consuming lots of ram ,   3.Browsing : i enjoyed browsing n reading on this device 5 inch vibrant display,good viewing angles, i also managed to watch movies online on UC browser by installing Flashplayer apk.   4.Gaming : Im not an Extreme gamer , anyhow managed to tested games like dead trigger,riptide,NFS,GTA,batman , which are below 1gb of size , tried playin Asphalt lags a bit. this phone aint for gamers wished it had 2 gb ram for excellent gaming experience   5.Sound: the Dual speaker in the front are good , audio is not so crisp n clear , my advice install POWER AMP for music lovers , Google Play music Sucks anyhow ! another big is u cant use ur headphone mic buttons for changing the music tracks only comes with sony,samsung,asus,xiomi since they got customized UI n functionality   6.Battery: Battery seems to drain up quickly if u turn on the Wifi or Celluar Data, used my phone upto 14 hrs with heavy usage of Wifii. try installing DU battery saver,Battery Doctor for saving juice.  It feels comfortable holding in one hand , the only 2 cons i have found is 1 gb of RAM n not so great Battery Back up   thats all about the review my advice is u to all purchase phones within 15 k, i bought samsung S3 for 36 k still in jellybean lots of Bugs almost trashed my phone away,after 1 yr now at the half price i get similar specs n a better phone n quicker updates, i change my phone for every year coz i only invest upto 15k   At last i hope u guys find this Review Helpful :-)",1 of 1 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,4 stars,awesome phone....i love this product,i am using this phone for almost 1 month and i think this is a good time to write a review.  Pros: 1 Attractive simple design of typical Moto. 2 Awesome gaming experience with no hang no lag no matter how heavy game you play on it. 3 294ppi makes the display very very nice . believe me it very fine and clear. 4 The video recordings are very clear and descriptive. 5 very handy and looks awesome on hands. 6 good processor speed. you can use as many app you can and won't get hanged.  7 The stereo speakers are so good amazing sound. Cons: 1 The camera is not so 8mp as it give the same quality image as my samsung wave's 5mp camera gives. 2 the battery won't stand up for 4-5 hours but its ok as i am using my phone every minute.but the phone exhausts 1% of battery every 3-4 minute. 3. phone gets heatup almost to 45-50 degrees Celsius if you use it for long on heavy games. 4 sometimes the touch act differently but it happens very rear.  Believe me Overall it's a very very amazing phone with this price range.I am really very happy and waiting for the android update of Lolipop. And in the end i really thankful to Flipkart for fast delivery.,1 of 1 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

You cannot delete selective messages in a specific conversation. I had this feature in a different mobile which i bought three years back. 5. You cannot delete all the contacts in one go. :((((( that's horrible. I didn't see the feature. 6. It doesn't provide File Manager.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,1 star,Motorolla G 2nd Generation a sham ..Please do not buy- A waste of your hard earned money,"I purchased a moto G 2nd generation from this website and within 3 months i experienced two major issues with the phone , firstly my phone began to hang within 10 days of receipt and the same was replaced with a new one... However, the motherboard to the new phone crashed within 1 and half month of receipt of the replaced phone rendering me handicap and phoneless..  Thereafter, I requested flipkart guys to replace the phone as I have never heard of the incident that a motherboard crashing of a brand new phone. After writing several emails to flipkart, they finally decided to reply to my email saying they will revert in 2 days which needless to say they conveniently slip the deadline and did not revert.And on being inquired again they only repeatedly gave me the option of taking my phone to he service centre and that they cannot offer me any more assistance than this very curtly put across to me. Worst is my phone is now lying with the service centre for more than 10 days and every time i visit them they tell me that they will take 2 more working days as they do not have the required part and the same has to be imported from USA. There are nearly 6 service centres in Mumbai with none possessing the required part. Because of he whole fraud committed by this platform which encourages vendors to sell defective phones I am rendered handicap without a phone and regretful of my idea of buying a phone online from this website ... It is therefore requested to everyone out there to not buy Moto G 2nd generation for we Indians who believe in good quality phones would not appreciate such major hurdles and issues in the phone within just 1 and half months of receipt precisely.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,"Moto G 2nd gen is cool, if you are planning for a smartphone go for this","Hey guys, 0  Thanks to Flipkart for delivering it within one day though I did not choose the option one day delivery.  About Moto G 2nd gen which is used for 2months now -  Advantages - Camera - Its really awesome guys, the clarity is so great its more better than the samsung grand 2's 8 MP which I compared with my friend so nowadays he asks me to take a pic from Moto G 2 though he has grand 2 ;)  Internal Memory - Oh its super cool which gives 16GB and its more than sufficient.  Processor - Moto G 2 is really fast guys. Trust me it is or check Moto G 2 Vs. iPhone 6 Video in Youtube(Moto G 2 is fast as per that video). Great for games.  Screen - its a 5"" screen and its so clear when it comes to camera or videos. Its great to see a video or play games.  Sim - Dual Sim works fine, also with 3G(for 1st sim only) and 2G. (2nd sim doesn't support 3G).  Speakers - Its really loud. The person next to you can hear what the person at the other end of the call is speaking with you if the volume is 100% so check your phone volumes or check if any person is next to you ;)  Inbuilt Apps - we can move apps to SD card or delete which is not required except few google apps. Good to handle, cant expect a better phone for this price.  Disadvantages - which we can see normally in other smartphones as well  Battery - this is also cool I use the wifi or internet almost 18hours a day and battery lasts for 1 day, I would suggest you guys to download the battery doctor app which helps a bit. Initially it was draining out bit fast but after 3-5 days it got adjusted and it lasts for a day. please judge on the battery after 3-5 days of your buying.  Heating problems - I do not see any such issues, charger was getting heated up initially but now I do not see such problems and never faced this with the phone.  I was confused if I should buy a Moto G 2 or Micromax canvas Nitro. But I am really happy with Moto G 2 its so cool. everyone who sees it asks for it ;) If you confused which one to buy I would say go for Moto G 2nd Gen. Anytime google phone rocks.",1 of 1 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,Awesome delievery timing,"I am not going to talk about Motorola, as i have already purchased 2 Moto G(1st Gen), 1 Moto G (2nd Gen) and 1 Moto E and also referred Motorola to many of my friends. I am talking here about Flipkart Delivery and Response on my request to deliver soon.   I had function in my home and ordered Moto G2 for gifting the mobile. Even though there was no stock till a day before function, flipkart delivered the mob on time as mentioned over the calls, that they will try their best to provide it on the day of function and they did. It was a nail baiting situation for me and had plans of buying Lumia 730 from outside mob stores. But i had faith in Flipkart and they kept to their words by delivering it on time. Every call with Flipkart ppl was polite and requestful to wait. Hats off to Flipkart, call centre ppl, delivery boy and its team.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,4 stars,Awesome phone,"Great phone. Excellent quality.  Cons ( I am just nitpicking, go get this phone) 1.Software needs updated as the phone feels sluggish occasionally and keeps killing background apps, like music stops in background if you open a couple of apps. 2.The dual sim management is a mess, more like an afterthought. No separate ringtone/profiles can be set. Number dialing is a two step process, dial > press call > select sim. 3. Average camera ( Horrible in low light)  Battery lasts a day for me, not more. About 30% left at the end of day. I use 2G all the time and wifi while at home. 2-3 hrs screen on time.",1 of 1 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,4 stars,Best Stock Android experience phenomenal price,"For all those Android purists like me, this is the blind choice when it comes to buying a new phone. No other device gives stock android experience at 13K.  DEAL BREAKERS 1. Stock Android 2. Promised Lollipop upgrade 3. Price  PROS 1. Decent battery life of 24+ hours with 3.5+ hours of on-screen time. (will get better with Lollipop upgrade) 2. Build quality is excellent, very comfortable to use with one hand. 3. Stereo Speakers - most awesome speakers. Even flagships like S5 do not offer quality speakers like Moto, they don't even have stereo. 4. Camera - excellent performance in sunlight, photos look crisp and sharp. Average performance in low light with flash.  COULD'VE BEEN BETTER 1. Option to turn of syncs completely - right now have to manually untick every option. (this is more of a stock android problem, I being an avid CyanogenMod user)  CONS 1. Charger with detachable USB cable - the out of box charger did not have detachable USB cable so I had to buy it. 2. Device heats up when performing things simultaneously like playing games and app updates from play store. (does not heat up when playing games only)  If you can tolerate these very minor cons, I think you should go for this device. Its the best in this range.",1 of 1 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

It has a decent primary camera. The phone does not experience any lag and games like Asphalt run seamlessly. Moto has provided useful apps like Assist. However the battery backup is not that great.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,The perfect buy at this price point,"I'm writing this review after one week of usage **the ratings are for the product and flipkart and not the courier service Delhivery. the worst delivery by the courier service, it took more than a week for the product to get delivered. unhappy with the service of Delhivery.  Now coming to the phone, after ordering the cell i read about the device and many of them said the cell heats up a lot, lags, takes long time to charge. i didn't face any kind of lag till now after installing many apps, yes the charger bundled with the product is not up to the mark but then i changed my charger and use the one provided with my nexus 7, and with that charger the cell get full charged in almost one and half hours without heating!  many of them said the battery is bad but that's not the case, if you are a normal user you'll get almost 16 hours of backup which is the best at this price point. for a gamer you can get 8-10 hours of usage.  the camera of the device is awesome, the focus control and other feature, simply love it.   the user interface is minimal and easy to use which i love. the customization by other companies make the device lag.  i didn't face any issues with sim card, calling function or wifi connection as described by others.  the stereo speakers are the best, people have said that the sound cracks, you can easily change the audio effects from the settings and i would advice you not to keep the media volume at full as you may feel the difference, keep it one or two times below and you'll get the perfect stereo experience.  the build quality of the phone is sturdy and fits perfectly in hand, didn't face any issues with the display or screen quality, it works as expected.  if your budget is around 15-20k go for this product without hesitation. none the devices from other companies can give you such build quality and beautiful looking phone  a big thumbs up for Motorola and Flipkart for giving the perfect device (Delhivery you suck!!!)

Antutu shows very bad chart for device's stability  Note:- I checked the temperature using CpuTemp, Clean master and antutu.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,1 star,buy it if u are an simple user,"I bought this phone in last nearly 20 days having found lot of problemms but i forget that cuase it may happens , But big problem is ""It cant support multitasking."" If u minimze any app after 5minutes it auto closed , even if u lock keypad. Or u cant not play music while playing a game or in game like clash of clans keypad goes down inbetween typing. N also it takes lot of more time to load a online game than samsung.  It having worst internet access i ever faced. If u are 2g user u need to forget browsing, any cheaper samsung or micromx mobile beat itmoto g2 4-5 times. Picture quality is not good as u want , moto e having gud coloured displaye than g2 ... About gameplay do not demand any shooting game... much lags.  Camera is gud than asus zfone5 or p81. (Chk camera wisly my handset fails to capture white at centered photos) ( n if it not responds u need to restart , even for face unlocking also). also face unlocking is not gud ( any mmx canvas is much better in this) any other person can open it n many times urself u cant open it ...epic fail.  About speed of using ...( is like running in river u cant get as speed as u can do ) i m not impressed by speed animated opening takes lot of time after some use ( nearly 15 Days)...  Sound no doubt awesome. Another bad thing is u cant see upload n dload working or not ( an internet E logo with two opposite arrows along signal)  System is just copy pasted from moto e ...icons r blurish.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,Brilliant,"I think the main issue everyone is concerned about is the battery life. Well, I can safely say that this phone has brilliant battery life. With 3G, I get 12-15 hours without any fuss. With WiFi, its even more. There is also a default batter saver option in Settings. Switch that on. Also, adjust the screen brightness when you're outdoors and indoors. Sometimes the Auto brightness indoors is quite bright and you don't require so much brightness indoors.  I use the phone a lot including media player in a day. If I remove my phone from charging at 9 in the morning, I charge it again next morning around 7/8am.  This phone is very good. Not much different from the First Gen. The only thing better is the camera and the screen size. Otherwise, its just like the first gen. And we all know how good the first gen is.  I dont want to comment on the specs as they're similar to the First Gen. The camera though is quite good, in low light too. Front camera is also great in low light.  The phone comes with stock Android. So that's another plus.  I read some reviews which described the battery life as poor, hence i was skeptical before i could purchase this. But once I bought it, I have no regrets.  Yes, there will be some handsets with some issues, but you cannot get 100% efficiency in anything.  I would totally recommend this phone for anyone looking for high end low budget smartphone. At 13k, its a steal.",1 of 1 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Firstly, there is an issue with the quality of speaker - when I receive call, Voice is not clear to hear ( A basic need/ Requirement of a phone) And if I have to receive call in busy traffic then god should help to understand what a caller is saying (As voice is not clear). Secondly, I noticed when I receive call most time my voice reflects back to me (Damn irritating).  Thirdly, an ear phone given by company is another big waste ....Sound quality is very very .. very bad......

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,1 star,Bad product and Fake warranty,"I had ordered Moto G (2nd Gen) mobile phone from flipkart. The same was delivered to me on 11th Sep 2014. Suddenly on 22nd Oct 2014 the phone display was blank. On calling flipkart , they informed that the phone cannot be replaced as it is more than a month. While it was just 10 days above the month(11th Sep 2014 to 22nd Oct 2014). On calling the Service center (Bell and tell Teleservices) we were informed to get the phone to service center. After 1 day, service center informed that the display was damaged due to physiscal damage. Flipkart informed that the warranty cannot be claimed as it was due to physical damage. Neither the service center nor Flipkart is able to prove the physical damage. Me being the owner of the phone, it is only me who knows if the phone had a physical damage or not. I am very dissatisfied with the service of Flipkart and Motorola and i Think this is just a way of avoiding the claim and reimbursement of the phone. I suggest please avoid buying atleast ecltronic items from flipkart.",1 of 1 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,1 star,This phone has lots of problems,"1. the battery backup is not so good. Charging takes hell lot of time (more then 5-6 hours). Battery heats up during phone usage and discharges very quickly. I start using my phone in the morning with 100% charging. By noon it drains to 40%. by 2 pm it requires fresh charging. Every hour it will charge only for additional 10 odd percentages.  2. the phone book has some serious problem. Opening contacts displays white screen for a long time. Contact names appear, and then if I search something the contacts disappear. Application closes abruptly.  3. Similar problem happens with Call logs. Sometimes, it doesn't even recognise the names and only the number displays without any name when someone is calling.  4. Poor Truecaller also stops abruptly.  So much with even the replacement set. :(",1 of 1 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,1 star,I regret not going by the reviews,"I have been a flipkart shopper since it was an Infant. Its tragic to see the services becoming progressively worse. Buying on this Big Billion sale was a bad decision. I have read negatives reviews about electronic goods and mobile sales on flipkart but always ignored them. I ordered Moto G 2 for Diwali.It was delivered fine. In 3 days the screen blinked on and off,touch got less effective, and then one fine day when I woke up half display was missing and touch stopped working. Immediately I made a contact with Customer team. They informed by 29th Oct they should rectify the issue but no calls from them, just mobile updates. And then Another message came that the date will be 31oct now. I totally regret buying it from flipkart. I have asked for a replacement and since I see many reviews on that part too I shall update my review once I get replacement done..If any??   31 Oct: I received replacement phone. Have not yet used it and I hope it works fine.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,4 stars,What You see is what you get,"Brand: Motorola was founded in U.S, 1928 and it builds Tablet computers, Mobile phones, Smartphones,Two-way radios (walkie talkies),Networking systems,Cable television systems,Wireless broadband networks,RFID systems,Mobile telephone infrastructure. So it is technically more renowned brand than Nokia or Samsung in Mobile phone market.   My Review is based on more than two weeks usage so it may vary at some points with others.  Looks: edges are not sharp, finishing is somewhat blunt and dull compared to ASUS  Zenfones.  Body: Easy to hold and handle though it's size is quite bigger than it may look. Back cover is so durable and more easy to open than a bottle cap!!!! it is sealed from inside out making it water and dust resistant to an extent. If you take the white version of this phone you will need a phone cover to protect it from stains! but you can open the phone back cover anytime and wash it and put it back :D  Screen: Corning gorilla glass 3 is something you may not believe before seeing. its smoother than ice but harder than past gorilla glasses. Still i use a Matte finish screen guard just for the looks it provide.  phone booting time: 28 secs generally. phone power off time:13 secs generally.  Phone accessibility: U.I is very smooth as it runs on Stock Android 4.4.4 as on Nexus phones only. no default file manager app. No notepad app. so many basic apps miss out in stock android. You will have to download them. 3G is very fast esp in Vodafone and airtel in cities. Navigation is smooth. music player is fluid except it interrupts for 0.5 secs when you tilt the phone from vertical to horizontal positions or vice versa. call facility is fluid. so is messaging. Notifications panel is nice to work with. but notification light is dull compared to blackberry's. sometimes you may face problems with receiving calls as the 'slide-n-answer' feature does not work at times but its very rare. I am trying to find out why it happens.  Sound: Very LOUD!   Camera: 8Mp is like Lumia's 5Mp. so nothing much to jump for! but front camera of 2Mp is good.  Battery: 2070 mAh. With D.U Battery app it gives you more or less 1 day/24 Hours backup. please charge your phone for 8 hours after buying as they say if you want proper backup.  My Review is based on more than two weeks usage so it may vary at some points with others.",1 of 1 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,"Amazing value for money, everything you need (in India)","I'll start with an excellent delivery by Flipkart. I ordered the device 4-5 days before diwali, the expected delivery time was 10 days due to festive season, but it was delivered to me in 3 days, surprisingly. i also ordered a moto g back case along with it which arrived the a day after that.  Moto G is a very well designed and thought out phone. I have handed it over to many of my not-so-Tech-aware friends, and they thought it was one more of those 30K phones with large screens. There's the look factor.  As far as performance is concerned: I switched from an iPhone 4S to Moto G, so just comparing the two phones - I find Moto G much faster and crisper in terms of the interface.   From an Android vs iOS perspective, there's just so much more you can do with Android than iOS. Apps like Whatsapp, PushBullet and Good work so much well on Android due to the deeper integration possible in the Android. Not to mention the whole issue with downloading songs using iTunes into iOS, which is such a buzzkill.  I am a big supporter of low-end phones like Moto G now (coming from a person who has been using Apple since >3 years). The high end phones are not worth it. They will give you the following things for 15K more of money. 1. NFC - Hardly accessible in India 2. 4G LTE - Not widely available in India - prices still high 3. Higher resolution - I mostly use my phones for reading news articles and watching HD videos- There is no need for full HD resolution in both - The internet bandwidth in India is hardly conducive to Full HD videos 4. Better battery life - I think this is the only thing in the list I would actually pay for. But in the end the trade-off comes to be like 500-800 more of mAh vs Rs. 15K. I think you could get a portable power bank for Rs. 3-4K (the best one in the market). So still Moto G wins.  Best of luck. There's more to life than spending on extravagant phones. Play smart.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,1 star,I am really highly disappointed with MOTO G2- BAKWAAS PHONE,"I ordered 2 phones  Moto G 2nd gen. Received on 25 & 28th September. I had much more expectation with MOTO G2.  1- When i started to use phone it shut down automatically.  2- Hearing voice use to stop after every 4-5 calls automatically, I have to restart the same after that it works but only for 4-5 calls. I was not able to receive the call. 3- Very poor battery - Charging time is more than discharging time. 4- After 7 days, hanging problem has been started.  5- Browsing problem  buffering during 3G activation 6- Phone heating problem 7- even 25th day, a phone has been dead.   I am really highly disappointed with MOTO G2 & dont want carry any more.   Friends, Please avoid the phone otherwise, I promise, you will remember my words.   I dont have any problem with flipkart, I am very old costumer of flipkart & first time I am facing such type of problem.  I have complained in flipkart costumer care, they picked up the same for exchange.  But exchange is not a ultimate solution, because there is some technical manufacturing fault, I am sure that itll not resolved.",1 of 1 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,3 stars,Good deal. Go through my observations.,"I have used two moto g2 phones for one month. These are my observations.  Cons: 1. Phone and the charger gets heated up badly during charging. Phone screen turns hot while watching a video for few seconds. Phone usually heats up during potential activities like using camera, on call, watching videos etc.  2. Touch sensitivity is not up to the mark.  3. The SAR value could be higher. As a result I suffer mild headache following a phone conversation which did not happen in my Nokia and Samsung phones. So using ear phones could solve the problem.  4. Battery consistency is extremely bad. I use my phone few mins to talk in a day, Check few mails and WhatsApp for few mins. Overall a very minimal usage and yet the battery lasts for only around 6-8 hours with full charge.  5. The case covers and screen guards are not widely available outside. It's very expensive online. I can as well get another phone for price of a case cover. I have been visiting shops in my locality since a month.  6. Camera quality is just OK. 7. PPI is less compared to the moto g1. So image quality appears less crisp.  8. Looks like cheap plastic used for back case cover. Not sturdy as 1st gen. So the back case can easily break.  Pros: 1. Good deal for this price. I got it just lesser than 10k for an offer.  2. Bigger screen is an advantage and disadvantage at times.  3. Not much lags and hangs till date.  4. Front Stereo speakers are just great.  Ultimately a good deal for this price.",1 of 1 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,UNBIASED REVIEW,"I am a college student and so you can very well understand i am a power user.I was very excited regarding this phone and it has lived upto my expectations.This is a completely unbiased review of MOTO G 2nd GEN.  1.Looks and feels premium. Erogonomically designed. Only the screen guard which came with it was not good and i replaced it. 2.Camera is very good.No complaints. 3.UI is excellent.No lags.Even when running multiple background apps. 4.Only the battery is not upto the mark. But make no mistake.1 hour of calls,20-30 pictures, 1-2 hours of net usage(2G), and another 1 hour of onscreen usage will sail you through the day with 30% of charge still left when you go to bed. 5. Those who have very sluggish internet speeds after switching to this phone...turn off location and restrict background data of Google Play Store and Google Services. You won't belive the amount of background data and battery these two consumes.  Close you eyes and go for Moto G. PS- Flipkart's delivery and packaging was excellent.",1 of 1 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,A good and balanced Android phone,"I purchased this phone for my younger brother. This is his first Android phone ever.   What I like about Moto G is that Motorola is giving a very balanced phone at a very nice base price. It has all the essentials one would absolutely want from an Android phone but it doesn't cost an arm and a leg.   The biggest problem with Android is that it gets slow over time. I don't know if that will happen with Moto G also or not as this is yet to be seen. This is an inherent Android problem and not of this hardware because Windows Phone based on same hardware such as Lumia 730 works really fast.   With the Android problem aside, this phone is good enough for anyone. It comes with a really good and sharp screen at near Retina Display quality with 1 GB RAM which is enough in Android for light use with 2, 3 apps running in background. At fresh boot with nothing installed this phone had only 370 MB RAM left which is something I find bad. The OS and Motorola bundled services are eating too much RAM and very less is left for user's own apps.   The camera is a standard 8 MP camera. It takes good pictures in well lit conditions. I haven't been able to test low light picture quality.   Audio quality from earphones or Bluetooth handsfree is also fine.   It is big due to a lot of bezel around the screen. Motorola needs to reduce this in Moto G 3rd generation. Also, 5"" screen is too much. A 4.5"" screen size with higher PPI or AMOLED screen which further reduces battery consumption which is what I would recommend. No need to give gigantic screen sizes, if you want that, launch another phone between Moto G and Moto X. Keep Moto G at 4.5"" screen size as not everyone wants a gigantic phone.   I purchased a Sandisk Ultra 16 GB MicroSD card for this phone as it is good enough to keep music, pictures and videos. I only keep apps in the phone memory.   The battery could have been better. Android is anyway not good with battery life.   I highly recommend this phone to anyone looking for a good enough and fast Android phone at a justified price.",1 of 1 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,Awesome Phone,"I bought this phone on Sept 12 and received it on 14th. I waited a month to write a review so I could see how the phone works after it is not so brand new.   I can now say this phone is pretty awesome. I am not having any problems with the battery backup. It lasts almost a full day with moderate usage. If I have WiFi on, it lasts a little less, but still gets me through the day.  There is no File Manager, you need to get another third party app for that like ES File Explorer. Android is as stock as it could get. No bloatware at all.   Now it's time for the Games. Not just normal ones but heavy games. I play Asphalt 8, FIFA 14 and FIFA 12; and it all runs butter smooth. The RAM is only 1GB, but it still manages to run the game smoothly.   The only problem with the 1GB RAM is that multitasking is a little harder. The phone is hell bent on killing apps, so if you have more than 4 apps on, 1 would be killed by the time you open it. Nothing big, though.   Headphones are great.   One problem is that we can't change the Notification LED Light.   Overall, a pretty good phone.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,1 star,not satisfied!,I had personally used Moto G that my sis bought and was happy to see such good quality in that price. the only flaw was he 5 mp camera. Moto G 2 went a step ahead with 8mp cam. so I booked it just the moment I realized it was released. Despite specifications being almost same the phone dint please me.  The Camera has some issues and goes off /needs restart of phone every now and then. also the auto flash does not work at times. the sim slot also seem to have prob. It all of a sudden disables my sim. this is really irritating. the touch also does not work properly at times specially while typing and playing games. Flipkart please suggest a appropriate action as I am really disappointed with the problems.,1 of 1 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,BEST VALUE FOR MONEY,"Hello every body. I purchased this phone after vigorous survey of mobile phones in the price range. What I observed is that this product is ultimate with all features which a 20K and above mobiles are providing at a price of 13K.  Pros: 1. Huge internal memory of more than 13 GB in 16 GB. 2. Excellent photos 3. Best User Interface (even a child can handle the features). 4. Can handle even the hardcore games like Real Racing 3 without any issues. 5. External memory with a capacity of upto 32 GB. 6. Dual speakers with good output. I installed mx player, a free app from playstore through which the sound is mind blowing. 7. Direct access to google drive, google photos. So we can have cloud store of more than 15 GB of data. Cons : 1. No NFC 2. Battery capacity of 2070 mah could have been a little higher. If we use wifi or play games, battery life is around 6 to 8 hours. Otherwise approx 16 hrs.3. No USB cable provided. Not even screen guard is provided with the product. 4. No file manager. I had to install a free app called ES file explorer which is a very EXCELLENT one.  Finally, the service of flipkart is appreciated. Within 2 days, I got the product. Immediately on unboxing and inserting SIM, all recent software updates got installed. Really nice. Best buy for the price tag. You will definetely like the product. Go for it.",1 of 1 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,1 star,Flipkart has broken the trust.,"I have lost my trust on Flipkart.  This review is not about the product, its about Flipkart. I have ordered the product on 12th Oct 2014, it was delivered on 13th Oct because I have opted for ""Flipkart First"" subscription for Rs 500/- a year.  When I opened the package, first thing that strikes is mobile has a scratch guard on it which doesn't have the logo of Motorola which you normally get when you purchase a product in a sealed pack condition. I have purchased Moto e and couple of my friends have purchased Moto G from Flipkart but all had that logo on the scratch guard. Which means I had been provided a refurbished product which someone might have returned.  It was not at all expected from Flipkart, when we are rooting for them against some foreign biggies, they shouldn't fool their customers like this. If you really want to sell refurbished product then you better list it out on your website.  When I contacted their Customer Care in the middle of night after identifying the fraud, instead of immediately taking the replacement request all they did was take the request for a call back from their technical team. While today on 14th Oct when I again contacted them, another executive placed the replacement request immediately. Since I have already subscribed for the in a day delivery, the least I'm expecting is they provide a brand new product in a day which is 14th Oct or latest by 15th Oct afternoon.  However, here onwards I would think twice before ordering anything from Flipkart. There is no need to hold a ""Big Billion Day"", just give us good offers and good service and stop cheating.  Hoping to get a brand new product ""In a Day"".  - A Pissed Off Customer",,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,4 stars,Pretty good.,"I bought this product from Flipkart recently and it has proved to be a worthy buy. The camera is really good (especially the slo mo video capture in 720p) with all the features mentioned in the specifications area and the the 1.2GHz processor with the 1GB RAM works perfectly. The phone is fast. Touch has a little bit of problem. The only drawback is that the battery is poor. Even though 2070mAh sounds pretty cool and fancy but the battery hardly lasts 12 hours. Even without playing any games and with battery saver on, I'm having to charge the device around twice a day. But overall with all the specs the phone is worth the money. The pulse notification light is handy. I'll say buy it.",1 of 1 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,4 stars,Screen is better than advertised by the reviewers !,"Working a 10 hour Shift Job on a freshers salary, I research the products I buy before I do get them.  Most of the Review I read told me that the Phone display is not so Great or that the battery wont last long, and that the phone over heats !  Phone's display is amazing. You wont even notice the drop in pixel density !   The 5 inch screen is really good.   I cannot boast about the phones I've owned over the days, but from the Experience that I have using phones that belong to my friends , I can tell you that If you are looking for a phone below 15,000. Go for the 2nd Gen Moto G !   I know there is HTC and other phones which are way better, but there is something about the Moto G that makes it a dependable phone.  The feeling that you have holding it in your hands, Knowing that a fall or a hit wont break it so easily.  Let me break it down in native review language   Pros  ********************** 1) The feeling of Holding it in your hand. 2) The screen is far better than advertised by the reviewers. 3) Have you tried MACRO Photography using the camera ? BRILLIANT !  4)The speakers are Good -- > Not great -- > but better than those who complain( Sometimes it good for people to understand that the sound that comes out of those speakers also depend on the file type , the bit rate of what you play).  Also about the speakers , True stereo (Nothing compared to HTC) but worth the money !  5) The feel Good factor :)  Cons ---- NO , I wont call it that, Things to Improve  *************************************************************  1) Battery   People who just got the phone like me tend to use if for hours on end, without giving the phone a break ----> The battery wont last long -- > 6 to 7 hours MAX !   People who have used it for a month now , finally giving the new phone a rest --- > Battery might last a whole day , If you are at work and rarely get time to play around with the phone, Then I'm sure It will last an Entire day .  Battery Could have been better .   On a final note,   I love the phone. Its everything that I have paid for and more.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,4 stars,"Moto G shows a lot of promise, but battery is a disappointment!","I just got my Moto G 2nd gen phone yesterday from flipkart, and I am loving it. Let me tell you that I just upgraded from a Sony W8 which I have been using for last 3 years. So my jump was pretty huge. From Android 2.1 to Kitkat. 128mb ram to 1GB, and a lot of other features. I also intend to keep this phone as long as the previous one.  I loved the kitkat version and since Moto G would be one of the first phones to get the Android L upgrade coming this month, I am more excited.   Display : Screen is amazing. Pretty clear, and resolution is perfect. Brightness is not a matter of concern. Performance : Based on one day i would say much, but the screen toggle and app opening has been pretty smooth. Games like Asphalt 8 ran quite decently. Wifi and my 2G worked well, giving good speed for net usage. I was happy with it. touch is also smooth. Felt no lags yet. Camera: well I lost interest in phone cameras some time ago. It is not that great, but not bad too. The settings look very mediocre, and they could have had more features I guess. Front camera was quite decent. I took a few good selfies with it.  Music: The sound is a bit disappointing even with the dual stereo speakers. The headphones are also very normal, and the earpiece don't fit well in my ears. Storage : 16 gb internal memory of which 12.79 gb is for user. I have used up 3 gb for apps already, but another 9gb free is quite good. Also have a 32 gb expandable external slot.  Battery: I charged till 100 and used wifi continuously for 14 hours till it drained out completely. Then I started charging again and its taking quite some time. Well its a new battery too. But I have o wait before i comment more about battery here. The charger is a single piece which i didnt like, unlike the usb to micro usb connector types.  Doesnt come with other accesories like tv connector etc like old mobiles did, but I never used them anyways. Neither did they feel obliged to add in one extra shell. We have to pay almost 1k extra for that.  But all in all I am impressed with the phone, as I am guessing its performance is in par with some of the higher end phones, with double or triple its price.  Received the phone from Flipkart without much hassle in 2 days.  Update after 3 days : ----------------------------  The performance of the phone is just awesome. I have been playing games like Asphalt 8 for the whole day and it seldom hangs for a moment or show lags. But it does heat up, but I think that is to be expected.   But the battery is a great disappointment. Candy Crush 'crushes' it in 3-4 hours itself. With other games like Asphalt and Temple Run, it does give some more, but still you can expect only about 6 hours and around. Otherwise you get a whole day if you are not so active on the phone with wifi. Wifi drains the battery too.That's a bit of a disappointment in the battery side. Battery-saver switches off wifi on its own. For a person like me who buys a new phone once in 4-5 years, I think battery is a prime criteria. So taking off a star.  Calls are clear and decent. Internet is fast. Screen is smooth.",1 of 1 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

With Snapdragon 400, I guess 720p makes more sense than 1080p. It is 5 inches in size but feels compact and usable in single hand. 2. Performance: Android 4.4.4 comes pre-installed. Lag-free so far. Runs Riptide GP pretty well. Should run all games meant for Snapdragon 400. MS Office, Facebook and Google Drive all work fast and fine.  3. Sound: The front dual speakers are awesome. Very nice sound.  4. Camera: 8 MP main cam & 2 MP front. Very good snaps so far both indoors and outdoors. Got only 20 mins to experiment :) 5. Call quality: 2 mics with noise cancellation and a loud speaker! Feels good. 6. Micro SD Slot: This is the greatest inclusion. Moto G sorely missed that. Good option. 7. It's a good deal.

Decent battery life - i get 3-3.5 hours of on-screen time with 22+ hours on single charge on single sim...almost same as s3 6. Vanilla android, minimal bloatware - higher free ram 7. Screen quality - i dont find any significant difference coming from s3 ( honestly never liked the over saturated colours on s3) 8. Good sound from front dual speakers  9. Touch response is good  Falls short in :- 1. 1 gb ram is not good enough for multi-tasking..1.5 gb ram at least would have been better. For e.g. when running chrome, poweramp consistently shuts down 2. Camera could have been better, s3 camera was better 3. Battery non-removable - if your device stops responding u may have a tough time  Overall, it is a budget phone which will definitely not disappoint.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,4 stars,Excellent phone for the price,"Pros:  Comfortable in the hand, display is clear, loud speakers. Native Android OS 4.4.4 without too many extras like in some other phones as micromax. Moto Assist is nice inbuilt app that can be helpful in automatically changing the setting from ring to silent depending on your calender.  Cons: Camera APP is not comfortable to use. I had to download Google Camera, but that hangs sometimes. The inbuilt dialler is not user friendly and you might need to download a dialler app that suits you. Battery may be an issue if you are continuously on games. Though after initial first few overnight charge cycles the battery run longer. Touch Sensitivity on phone for most part is good, but sometimes it seems to think I have tapped the phone rather slide it.

Not able to hold it.  3rd Day Experience: No File manager exist inbuilt so downloaded File Manager App. Copied 800mb movie & 150mb song(both HD clarity) Both haven't run with inbuilt app. Used VLC to play them. Noticed a lag while running 800mb file movie. No lag with 150mb file. After 10 mins usage of Wifi & playing 10 mins video phone became hot again.  Today's(4th Day) Experience: Heating problem is same, it becomes very hot at rear camera after 10 mins usage. Surprisingly Pics quality increased, both rear & front cams giving good clarity pics.  Heating Heating Heating... No USB cable provided. Headphones are normal, not in-ear, quality is average. No File Manager & Menu button provided inbuilt.(Can't do multiple deletions or selection) Two speakers, but Stereo speakers, sound is OK. No secondary mic, no noice control, pic & video clarity is just OK. Inbuilt battery(for me I am normal user so Satisfied) Except the above 5"" inch screen is very cool..  good clarity, good touch, good design, good memory,  kitkat, 8MP 2MP Camera, good browsing experience,  gaming experience is very satisfied,  I dont recommend this coz what is the use of having so many features... this heating problem is irritating & burning my hand after every 10 - 15 mins of usage. Not even able to hold it or keep in pocket.",1 of 1 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,4 stars,Moto G 2 for All,"Namaskara to all,   I am using mobile since 15 days now , you guys know about the good features of moto g , i will say negatives of moto g , cos when i was buying i used to see about the negatives then positives.  1- batttery will lasts only for 5-6 hours if you use it heavily i mean games, wifi, Bluetooth, live wallpaper, etc etc .. all at once, else it last for about 17-18 hours may be more if u use it as a basic set.  2- charging from 0-100% takes 3-4 hours , this is what is upsetting, i think its normal to all moto g, but again it not a problem, if you are't a hardcore user.  3- If the moto g heats up using it heavily back of camera will be heated u can feel it, tho it is not like you cant hold it , but you can experience bit of more than normal heat.  4- back cover cases is so expensive from moto , hope the piece should be reduce.  PS :- Flipkart delivered with in 9 hours ! wow thats great, not a word for flipkart.  Hope i helped you. Regards",1 of 1 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,Ultimate satisfaction,"First of all, thanks to Flipkart. Delivery was fast, packaging was very good and product is in ideal condition. Keep it up guys :) Now coming to the product itself. I received it yesterday, I found this phone to be very good. All the praises everywhere around about the resurgence of Motorola and the positive reviews were the reasons for me to opt for the 2nd gen Moto G (and my budget too :P). And I must say, even after such huge expectations, I'm not disappointed. No need for me to delve into the specifications, as Flipkart has summarised them very well. Till now, I haven't found any problems worth writing about. But there's just one problem with Android Kitkat (it's not a con of this phone, mind it). You cannot set the default memory for your bluetooth transfers to your external SD card. All the files are occupying the internal storage, and I can't even move the files later to the external SD card (I'm using Androzip file manager). This is the only con that I found till now. Everything else is great. Highly recommended for those who want to buy a smartphone under 15k. :)",1 of 1 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,MOTO G 2nd gen,"Flipkart delivery was awesome , got the phone next day itself. Now coming to the phone. After using the phone for about a week i must say its a charm...Feels good in hand. Display is brilliant and plays videos with great clarity 1 gb ram + Snapdragon processor does not make any kinds of lags atleast on the basic usage. I haven't tried gaming yet but im sure this phone can handle high end games. OK google works perfectly Camera is awesome..both front and back camera are good Good internal storage...SD card expandability is also there..SO plenty of memory available. Latest version of android 4.4.4 CONS: Charger is only 550mah so it takes a lot of time to charge..better try other chargers. Heats up a bit sometimes...only sometimes(Usually all android phones heat up) Earphones are just OK but not good for listening music..buy a good earphones if u want to enjoy music. Battery backup could have been upto 2500mah but still it works for a day with moderate use. People don't go crazy over Xiaomi.. Buying that phone itself is so difficult then imagine their after sales service. Also MOTO has a good brand image and after sales is growing widely in India. This is the best phone to buy if ur budget is around 10-15k Motorola has literally killed the market...Keep rocking moto...And THanks to flipkart",1 of 1 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,4 stars,"Moto G 2 reasonable price, good performance, poor screen resolution","I am using the new Moto G Gen 2 since last week and find it quite a smart object at an affordable price point. Do not expect a sleek metal finished smartphone at this price. However, the screen resolution at 720p looks pretty dull when I set the brightness to Auto mode. 1080p is required for 5 inch smartphones. The standard camera does not allow auto flash or flash function and the option keys are hidden on the right side. I downloaded the Google Camera app and now it is working fine. The phone is nice to hold but after slipping on the protective cover it looks bigger and bulky. I have also applied a matt finish screen guard which changed to looks of the phone. Overall the user experince is nice. 1 GB Ram + 16GB internal + 32 GB microSD makes the phone a small datacenter.

CONS:   1) Colours in the display look a bit washed out. 2) The stock charger provided with the phone has an output of only 0.5A & therefore, takes hours to get fully charged. Better to use a charger with a higher output. 3) The front firing speakers are a major disappointment. Expected a much better sound output.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,Thorough review after using 2 weeks.,"I've been using this phone for the last two weeks and here is my review..... 1. Look: There is no remarkable change from the previous moto g in overall but the addition of duall speaker in front makes the phone looks like moto e but look more premium. 2. Performance: If u used the moto g 1st gen then there is no difference in performance since both have same processor and ram but the slight upgrade in the display size (0.5 inch) makes the 2nd one better in our experience. 3. Camera: Here is the big difference from the first gen.moto. the rear cam is equipped with 8mp autofocus camera but no image stabilizer. But moto g 2 takes descent foto in outdoor and good image in low light also. The front cam is 2mp cam and it is quite good for video calling but not that good for selfie. 4. Battery: Here is the down point of the 2nd gen from the 1st one. If u used the phone with 3g on and display always on with surfing or listening song the battery will last only for 7 hrs from full charged to hit 5%. But it is not that bad because we hardly use phone like that. But I tested myself to know the performance. For normal users with some surfing, listening some songs, talking with girlfriend and playing some casual game the battery will last for almost a day. Due to having bigger screen I expected this from the battery as u know guys. 5. Gaming Performance: The moto g 2 can also handle all the present HD games just like the previous one. I tested MC4, NFSMW, Asphalt 8, Fifa 14, Dead trigger 2 and Nova 3. All games run quite smooth without seeing noticeable frame drop. Due to having sharp and crisp 720p display and deliver descent viewing angle u will find comfortable playing HD games in this Phone.  Final verdict: If u r hardcore gamer and camera lover but don't want to burn a hole in ur pocket then This device is specially for u. It is much better than the other mid range phone from Sony Samsung HTC since those phone's price will fall nearly on 20k with the same specs. I experience Xiaomi mi3 myself which deliver premium specs and performance but can't promise the after sale service like OS upgrade repairing etc. Besides Xaiomi phones have some issues which are so frequent in many of their phone but not all like heating problem losing signal etc.",1 of 1 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,4 stars,A Mid Range Android Device with Very Good Performance,"I am posting this review after using the phone for 11 days. Had placed order on 9th Sep in First Day Launch Offer and received the order on 10th (as promised In a Day delivery, Rs. 90 Extra). I am ok with Rs. 90 extra cost for such an assured delivery in a day. So as usual Flipkart at its best. I am a happy & satisfied consumer of Flipkart till date.  Honest Review of the Device: A smartphone which has capacity to handle multitasking with nice Camera, Sound & UI. Though there are some cons too.  PROS - 1. Good UI, touch is awesome, better than Samsung Galaxy Grand or Micromax Canvas. I liked the launcher and the bright inbuilt wallpapers which is not like cheap androids. It has a class. Four Star.  2. Sound system is awesome. I liked the sound system if you have a headphone with ear-bud. The Bass/treble/Vocal/Bass Punch modes are fabulous. Five Star.  3. Camera is too good with the price range. I have used Lumia 720/Galaxy Grand, compared to these it has advanced features. Secondary camera can capture nice Selfie. Four Star.  4. First time user of Kitkat version of Android. Its a very light OS compared to JB. No hang/lag observed during regular operation/accessing internet. Though I am not crazy for Games, though basic games (Temple Run2, Crazy Grandpa, Rail Rush, Asphalt Bike runs smooth). Four Star.  5. Keyboard is just awesome. Kitkat OS has some good featured Keyboard. You can just drag the word you want to type, it will fetch it automatically. This feature is best while travelling/walking. Five Star.Four Star.  6. Connectivity is good and dont have any problem with it. Both SIM works perfect together. Four Star.  7. Speaker output is perfect with two front speakers. Four Star.  CONS - 1. Battery is average, no so good backup like Nokia. If you use Wifi/3G for more than two hours a day, it drains fast. Though in 2G it gives you good life. I need to make frequent calls/sms for 8 hours in a day which is not an issue with the device. Three Star.  2. Heats up a little bit while charging, but do not pay attention to it. Its a minimum heat which generates like many other Androids like Samsung/HTC/Micromax/Xolo/Xiomi MI3 etc. while charging. Three Star.  3. The Headset which is given inside the Box is very normal and with low quality. Two Star.  4. No Data cable is given inside the box, its only a Socket charger. Two Star.  Hope the review will be helpful all the buyers who are planning to get it.  I would say, GO FOR IT, its the BEST ANDROID (Kitkat) PHONE IN RANGE OF 13K.",1 of 1 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

I have placed my order on 6th Sep'14 (ODA6829931639PCVNH00) with launch day 6 offers - which was said to be delivered on 11th (5 days after ordering). I followed up again on 12th for delayed and was replied to deliver again on 18th (12 days). which was also false committed. There was no mail for delay. Finally i cancelled my order, where in they are not at all concerned or to apologize. This may be that they have saved there offer but lost customer (May be customer's).

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,4 stars,VERY GOOD FOR ME - BUT THE BATTERY!!,"Ordered on the launch day i.e. 6th Sept.(12:04 a.m.), received on 9th Sept. (about 11:30 a.m.) i.e. 1 day before the expected date. SATISFIED with the delivery.  But the offers that were for the launch day buyers were actually ridiculous. Not of much work for majority. Anyway...that's not important.  Lets come to the phone performance-  1. Camera- 8/10  +Very good picture & video quality, good slow motion video recording, flash also good. Low light photos are equally good for the flash. photos and videos can be made in full dark also. use the flash as a torch also using downloaded torch app or cleanmaster app's widget.  Front camera is also very good.  -But after zooming not that much picture clarity.  2. Display- 9/10  +5 inch screen very attractive and display quality also good. Gorilla glass protection helps very much. screen protector is not must for that.  -The screen guard provided was not set good. very bad.  3. Game- 8/10  +Every game I tried works quite good. games like gta vice city, fifa 14, max payne, asphalt 8 etc.  -But Graphics can be set maximum to 60-65% range for flawless performance. Otherwise the game cant be played for lag (checked only for gta vice city). But its not that much problem as upto 60-65% range the graphics quality is good enough. and the fifa14 stopped several times after tapping 'tap to continue'. I had to reinstall it once and the next time it got fixed automatically.  4. RAM- 10/10  +No LAGS normally.  5. Looks- 10/10  +Very good looking phone. REALLY! both from front and backside.  6. Sound- 7/10  +Good sound quality. call sound is also very loud.  -But in some cases (for specific songs or games) its not that much loud. but OK. earphone doesn't go with the phone itself, but OK.  7. Network- 9/10  +No network problem till now. Used Vodafone and Airtel. Both Airtel and Vodafone 3G worked well.  8. Battery- 5/10  -For normal usage like a bit gaming, some camera use, calls, sms, some gps it will give 8-10 hours back up with auto brightness on while not using the phone, I think. But if you use continuously, I think it will not give you more than 2-3 hours backup. I checked for full brightness and much camera use and gaming that it reduce the battery very quickly. Not tried the internet connectivity that much till now.  Have ordered a power bank worth Rs. 749!  N.B.: The charger I received worked for one day only and then stopped working. does not charge. totally useless. But for me its just nothing problematic because I have same chargers from before as its a very common charger. For most people it wont be a problem. But those who doesn't have those from before, they'll definitely face problems and will have o buy a charger.  But I think its a special case that the charger didn't work. It'll work for most of the others, I think.  In all, its a good impressive product and keeping aside the battery issue its a good buy in this range.  Recommended- 7/10  Happy Shopping :-)",1 of 1 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,A negative review with positive thought :P,"Well there are many reviews already on this phone .. i would like all to know about all bad's of this phone P.S I own this phone for about 8 days and i absolutely love it .. i have no hatrance towards this. So Cons are:- 1:- BACK COVER People say it have a rubberised finish but i didnt found it like this .. it's really smooth plastic and slip a bit .(but official flip covers have good variety and have good grip with bakc covers 2. DESIGN I found the design to be bit confusing because while using phone something i end up holding it upside down. i beilve there should be some logo on the front up side too. 3. BATTERY 2070mah . That might average while seeing in number but let me tell you battery backup is quite amazing . you wont have any issues regarding the battery backup . beileve me . only bad thing about battery is that it takes way too much time to charge ..(idk the exact time but its little higher than samsung mobiles of this battery capacity) 4. CHARGER Yes. It do get hot after using . maybe charger is manufactured to work for foreign country plugs and thats why it gets heated here in India ( coz they have added an extra plug on top of the charger) 5. NO USB CABLE. That's quite annoying coz you have to remove back cover always and use a card reader >:O. 6. CAMERA. Quality of camera is superb .. It shoots amazing pics but the interface you see on the camera is 6 MP . if you change it to 8 MP, then dont get full interface of the screen while taking pics .(but that really doesnt matter and doesnt effect resolution and clearity). 7. SPEAKERZZZZZZ Well This is one of the biggest issue with this phone .. phone is not at all loud enough so that you can hear .. will watching an youtube video in your room with your ceiling fan on , you won't hear even a single word . 8. HEADPHONES. Headphones provided with set are really annoying to ears as they are also not so loud + they really hurt after about 30 min of use . (BUT if you use any other headphones liike philips , jbl or samsung ; they work really nice and very loud).  One More Thing .. I own an White coloured phone which looks way much better than black one . but white colour is more prone to stuffs like dust , ball pen ink etc but dont worry they get easily removed on hard rubbing .. I would recommend to buy black phone if you are not much interested in showing off but let me tell you . The kind of look you get while holding a white phone is amazing . I Beileve black phone only suits with comapnies like Iphone coz they got glassy back panel. And At Last , i found the flip covers and back covers to be very expensive . 1700 and 800 respectively (Review Dated 18-Sep-14)",1 of 1 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,1 star,Highly disappointed.,"18/9/14  Touch: Touchscreen is not working properly. I have to press four five times. It doesn't get registered sometimes, I feel I am moving my finger on just plain glass.  My piece has a bad touch response. Cant even use the phone.  Camera: Camera has issues. If you keep flash on/auto and click pictures of very closeby objects like 5 cm or 10 cm close, the flash doesnt turn off. You have to restart the phone and start camera app to turn off the flash. I dont believe camera issue is hardware one, an update might fix it (no updates yet). But still, its annoying.  Didnt face any heating while using yet.  Charger gets hot, but not that you cant hold it in your hand. But it takes time to charge.  SD card: SD card gets disconnected when phone is on, or even sometimes doesn't detect SD card.  I had enquired on phone about the phone having issues while the phone was still being shipped. I saw 4-5 continuous reviews, where people faced problems. I asked the sales representative about the phone, as many people had received defective pieces, whether the batch they received was good or not. They told me, that the product is good, no problems are there.   Requesting for replacement.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   19/9/14 12.51 pm Flipkart representatives called me regarding the return request. They told me to do a factory reset. I did that, put all the details, email id etc.   Still touch is having problems and SD card is getting unmounted.  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 19/9/2014 4.05 pm My phone is dead now within 24 hrs without using. Not starting at all. I might have used it for only 2 hours, from the usage stats in phone. I didn't have a micro sim so couldn't use call functions. Touch was defective and SD card was getting unmounted. And now its dead.  Highly disappointed with Motorola. They should atleast give better phones than Micromax, or Chinese Phones. Don't dump phones which were rejected by EU/US standards in India.  Flipkart should stop selling Moto G 2nd gen for sometime, until Motorola realizes its mistake.  Please new buyers, don't buy this phone until Motorola improves the product. Many products are defective. Wait if you want to buy Moto G 2nd gen. Go for Android one if urgent. Then you can change over after sometime.",,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,4 stars,A really Impressive Phone,"The product is really good. As mentioned hats off to flipkarts delivery system. I got the product within a day of ordering.  Now coming to the Phone itself Motorola has done quite a few major changes that has brought this product in par with all the other competitive phones like Asus Zenfone and Xiaomi Mi3.  Pros: 1. Brilliant Display seems Corning Gorilla Glass has done wonders to the screen instead of the display density being a bit less than previous Moto G. 2. Gaming performance is also good. Games like Asphalt 8 and FIFA 14 run flawlessly. 3. Battery backup is average. 4. The stereo speaker is really impressive as the speaker are at the front so while holding the phone the sound doesn't get blocked.  Cons: 1. While playing games, the phone does tend to get heated up a bit. 2. Sometimes there is a burning smell of some sort from the earphone jack while using the phone a bit. I hope flipkart sorts out this issue a replace this model. 3. I hoped Motorola to give 2 gb ram in this set. But 1gb is sort of ok is used to a limit.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,3 stars,Motorola but made in China !!,"I have orders Moto G 2 and Gen on launching day. Received quick delivery from flipkart 5 star rating for it . I think Motorola ia an American but I disappointed to see chinees manufacturing.after 10 day experience I am giving review as under. Pros: Screen is smooth and crispy. Light weight and comfortable in pocket  5 inch display how ever compact in size, easy to hold in hand. Grip is best. Look wise beautiful then other brand Moto assist is good appl. Cons: Camera both is good not best , Picture quality in zoom is worst. There is no USB data cable. RAM is 1 GB like Moto E why we should spent doublemoney just for front cam & slight more big display ? Internal Memory of moto E also expendable. No file manager provided so I can not found to send voice clip or song by Bluetooth. Connectivity is major problem.can not catch weak tower , while my other Samsung and Intex handset don't loose tower of same service provider (BSNL) so using net is being headache sometime. As phone is made in China there is no difference in configuration with Xiaomy or Gionie etc. No regional language except Hindi is supported so can not read this language in fb, website etc. This type of problem is not in Samsung. Headphone is worst and China brand.charger is OK.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,4 stars,Moto G 2nd Gen is a OK phone,"1) Everyone here telling flipkart service is good. But i am not happy with flipkart delivery speed because it is average like other online retailer. 2)About the phone - HD display is good, feels comfortable during long usage and high definition videos.  3) Phone is crisp and can be easily handled with single hand because the back side (mat finish) is pretty cool 4) Sound quality of the speakers are amazing no words it's just rocking  5)LED notifications lights are not up to the mark 6) Sim slot is not compiling with all sim cards. Many times it gives problems & it's very hard 7) Battery backup is not good for heavy usage.But if yu are a avg phone user then it's ok 8) When taking images that have good and punchy colours but the details are missing even in 8MP and little problem is the presence of noise in close-up shot and Indoor pictures. 9) Mot is not provided USB cable 10) Touch experience and speed is avg",1 of 1 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,Pure awesomeness,"Just got this phone yesterday and i have been continuously using it since then. ->I'll rate it 3/5 for front looks, like any ordinary micromax! but the back side (mat finish) is pretty cool.  ->Sound is pretty great with the dual speakers. ->SPEED IS LOVELY, specially if you are a heavy multi-tasker its a go! ->Lag free performance even in high graphic games(asphalt 8) so if you are a gaming freak but cannot go for the 20k segment its the best :) ->Display is good, feels comfortable during long usage and high definition videos. ->Cameras are great  The worst thing about the phone is the battery back up! Battery drains like anything! So if your usage is mostly at the places where you dont find charging ports you should have a second thought.  Overall a brilliant phone! At this price what more could one ask for :D GO FOR IT :)",1 of 1 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,4 stars,Awsome phone in best price!!!!,"Firstly i will thanks to flipkart team for quick delivery!! Moto G2 is a excellent phone in this price range. Battery backup is quite ok. In normal use battery discharge only 50% in 12-13 hr. In gaming,internet surfing it discharge upto 80% in 6-7 hrs.  Phone can play full HD videos, asphalt8, subway surfer etc with no lag or hang. Its a pure android phone which betters its performance as compare to others having same configuration.  It has Gorilla Glass 3 & scratch less back cover which is not present in some high budget phones eg:Samsung grand2 worth 19K. A value for money phone.  but one thing im sugesting to flipkart that the flip covers and back cover price is too high please provide some offers to it !! love you flipkart!!!",1 of 1 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,4 stars,Grey side of MOTO G2,"I am using this phone since a week now. Its a very good phone as i own it but... I would talk regarding the Con's  1. Battery 2070 mAh is a very big mistake with a 5 inch display.. With wifi on, casual chatting n facebooking it lasts just 10hrs.  2. Charger is too slow takes approx 2.5 to 3 hr to charge from 15% to 100%.  3. Stereo Sound, ahuh aint that impressive nor are its plastic made handsfree.  4. Quad core 1.2 Ghz processor, its takes 1-2 sec to open whatsapp's certain conversation, and uploading 10 images at a time gives a black out of 2 sec. apart from whatsapp its smooth.  5. 1 GB RAM sounds a bit less for the price tag it has got, ASUS gives more.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,Its a good brand I hope it will last long and don't require the need of service Care,"Display is awesome,viewing angel is also very good.color reproduction is good also. Sound quality with dual speaker is very good and clear.call quality is awesome. Camera is good in both lightning Conditions.pics are very clear just let the camera 1st focus properly. Design is good. I am very basic user so battery lasts for 1 1/2 days.I feel the battery will last 4 to 5 hrs with heavy and continuous use. If you are a basic user then follow the steps to improve battery performance: 1-off auto sync 2-off WiFi network and data connection when you don't need them 3-GPS system off(location service).  4-use minimumbrightnesss/auto brightness 5-screen timeout 15sec/30sec  Performance of phone is lag free and very fast. Recommend: don't use unnecessary background apps.  I bought it only for its brand . I hope it will last long. I could buy Micromax but I felt , that is excellent only in spec not in quality.  Generally these Brand's products are less time span compared to other good brand like Nokia,moto,apple. Generally its a pain to run service center.  Everything is good except battery; but it will improve just after the Android L update. So buy it ;nothing could be better than this on today's date.......

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,4 stars,"Value for money, but battery is suspect","I'm a heavy duty user of smartphone features, and i found the moto g- gen 2 to be an excellent buy for the price ; Caveat - i have only been using it for 3 days so far, but i have noticed the following : Smooth performance, good handling, the touch interface is faultless and has all the features that one needs...   The one challenge i have faced is that the battery takes far too long to charge. It took over 3.5 hours to go from 30% to 100%, and also the charger that comes with the kit heats up quite a bit during the charging process.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,Nice product from Motorola.,"I ordered the Moto G2 on 6th september..and got it delivered on Sunday 7th september afternoon..But unfortunately I got a defective handset, the phone's LED Flash wasn't working. Launched a complaint..and got it replaced by Thursday 11th September. Hats off to the Flipkart Delivery system, because getting your product replaced is not so easy through online platforms. Anyways. about the phone.. PROS : 1. Excellent display - The screen is crisp and all colours look lively. You won't complain about the screen at all. 2. The Stereo Speakers - Great sound quality, better than the earlier gen. of Moto G, you would definitely enjoy playing games and watching videos. 3. The Camera - Good camera, fast focusing, great flash. Overall the camera is really good at this price point. 4. Updates - Motorola has already confirmed that this phone would get the Android L update, so chill :'D 5. Build Quality - The curved back gives an awesome feel to your hands and makes it easy for you to hold. 6. Battery - I basically used my phone for browsing (45 min), Games (20 min), Watching videos (20 min), social messaging (25 min) and listening to music for 2 hrs..And surprisingly, I got battery backup of 20hr+..So it's great, at least for me.  CONS: 1. The camera could have been better in terms of sharpness. But it won't be a deal breaker for you. 2. The RAM and Processor can be a problem for some of the people  At the end, I would suggest you guys to buy this phone if want a nice stylish phone at this price + a branded and reliable company like Motorola.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,1 star,Camera and Flash functionality issue,"I have ordered two mobiles and found flash functionality issue in both the phones.  when tried to autofocus the near objects(when flash is set to AUTO or ON mode), the flash is getting hung and not shutting off even after switching off the mobile. To switch off the flash, need to restart the mobile and open the camera app. No issues when flash is set to off.  All buyers, please do verify your mobiles, as this issue has been spotted in all the mobiles which me n my friends had bought.  Try doing this to verify whether your mobile has this problem or not:  > Set your camera flash to ON or AUTO mode. > Try to place some piece of paper which had some text in it and put the paper very close to camera. (very little gap between ur phone and the paper) > Try taking the pic or try to autofocus. Here the actually issue starts, the mobile tries to focus the text but the flash goes to a hung state. Meanwhile, you can even use ur mobile but flash will be glowing all the time. To switch off the flash, need to restart the mobile and open the camera app.  As, i have found this issue in all the devices which me n my friends bought, it might be the issue with the hardware.   Apart from this issue, everything works flawlessly.   Raised a complaint to Flipkart and asked us to wait till we get a call from technical team.  Tried calling mutliple times to call center, they need 24 business hours( 3 days ) to just know the details about the issue.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,Great Product and fits in budget.,"The Phone comes along with a charger and a set of earphones. Nice compact packing. I'll cut the case and get to business.  Pros: 1) 5 inch screen. the older version in smaller. good for people looking for a big cellphone. 2) Battery. It helps me go through out the day without charging. my daily usage is mostly moderate with frequent use of WiFi, 3G, good use of camera, and small games like Minion Rush or Quiz Up. Even with all these running whole day, the battery stays above the critical level. It takes a bit to charge to the full limit but even 60 percent is enough to get through the day. 3) Speaker. Two Speakers and stereo effect. Loved this feature. watching movies and videos with friends doesnt take much effort now. everything is audible even in a busy room.  4) Multitasking. Apps run smoothly with other running in backgroud. 5) Memory Slot. finally! thank you motorola! 6) Dual sim. well, i am using one right now. 7) Looks. Great. Fits well in hand. and Looks very rich for its price. 8) Camera: 8mp with 2mp secondary. both work well. took a few pics. the focus works good in the primary cam. secondary cam is a bit shaky, but i guess thats my fault because i am not used to clicking through the front cam.  9) Android L coming soon (excited)  Cons: 1) Pixel density is still the same as previous model. this is not a big issue, as the display is still crisp and great. this shouldnt be a problem. everything looks great.   i dont think you will find anything like this at this price.",1 of 1 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,Excellent Android Phone,"Ordered 2 days before and received Yesterday! Fantastic delivery. Couldn't keep up with the tracker's speed :)  I am using this product since yesterday I received and I charged my mobile yesterday in the evening still 62% battery is there. I am using the net on wifi mode, listening music, receiving calls, Whatsapp, playing Subway surfers. Now I can say that the battery backup is excellent. Even the Charger is not heating while charging. So guys whos charger is getting heat up while charging kindly get it change from flipkart.  Camera performance is much much better than the old Moto G.  While Playing games it never hangs so I can say the processor is also good as compare to all the samsung phones having 1 GB or Ram in that it hangs while playing game. I even played asphalt 8.0 and it is working great.  Regarding the look and feel I cant keep myself away. I just love holding on my hand its very light.  If you come to the screen resolution you cannot say that its 720P or 1080P until you go through the Specification. The content is sharp and clear.  The sound is very loud and clear, even while attending a call or making a call there is no noise disturbance, the word spoken is very clear to me as well as to the receiver. Even the headphone sound is very loud and clear.  While talking I didn't find any network drop.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,"Simple, yet smart!","Since by now everyone knows what specs this phone has, I won't pass your time making you read technical stuff. My hands on experience with the phone:  1. First Impression is the Last Impression - The speed, the hand-feel and the buttery touch will make you smile the moment you switch it on. The big screen is indeed a wonderful update to the good ol' Moto G 1st Gen  2. Setting you up - This phone configures/personalizes all your stuff within minutes. Google is indeed biased towards its product.  3. Camera - I am a photographer, and trust me, though people may start comparing this phone with its immediate competitor Micromax Canvas Nitro (which has a 13 MP & 5 MP camera), I would say don't get wooed by megapixels. This phone's camera has a pretty decent sensor.  4. Memory too less - Is it? Well, technically yes. 1 GB is definitely not a pro in this multitasking world. But for users like me out there, who love to spend time more on social media, news, comics, magazines and other similar things, this phone will not disappoint you.  5. Battery - A small problem indeed since now you have a powerful screen to touch with the same 1st Gen battery. However, with the right apps and usage (and I don't mean you won't play games or not browse the internet), you can pretty much make it last for 24 odd hours.  6. Storage - Looks pretty decent to me. I am never going to cross 48 GB (16 GB + 32 GB MicroSD) anyway.  7. Size, bulkiness, weight - This is a very light, slim and easily-comes-in-the-pocket phone. I have short fingers, so I got to use both hands for operation.  8. EDGE/Wi-Fi - Can't really update you on 3G, but EDGE and Wi-Fi experience has been good so far.  I got it on 9th September. Still a new user, and hence will keep sharing my experiences here in the days to come. However, I would strongly suggest you to buy this over any other phone in this range.",1 of 1 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,The Best Sleek Smartphone for this price ....,"Dear All,  This is my consecutive second mobile from flipkart after the previous Moto G. First of all thanks to Flipkart and Team, the delivery is the best and incompatible. Coming to the specifications of the Moto G 2nd Generation:  1.The box contains accessories like the charger and the headphones (not worth it). Use headphones like Sony, JBL, etc, the music is really superb. The charger is not a USB mounted charger. So please ensure to have your own USB cable for data transfer.  2.The phone is very slim compared to the earlier Moto G and it is very light in weight when thinking of any other 5"" smartphone.  3.The looks and design of the phone are worth appreciating. The Clear Black Body with the Corning Gorilla Glass 3 and the Black Matt finish at the bottom, feels to keep it in hand for hours and hours. The resolution of the screen is HD.   4.The display of the phone is very crisp and sharp, the wide angle display is also good. the pixel density is 294 ppi.   5.The phone has 2 speakers, on the front and the output of the sound is very loud and clear. The sound is very high when compared to the sound of the previous version of Moto G.   6.And now the most awaited moment for all the Moto G 2nd Generation buyers, the Motorola team has come up with a variant launched in India, having 16gb internal memory and expandable memory slot upto 32 gb.  7.The camera quality is way way way way way way .... better than the previous version of the Moto G. The 8 mp quality is really good in the natural light and above average in the indoors. The front facing camera is decent with a 2 mp. The video resolution is HD.   8.The advantage of buying this phone is that the Google has already announced that it would be having the next Android Update of LOLLIPOP, Android L for this phone. It comes with the Kitkat version of 4.4.4 and with no pre-loaded apps like the other smart phones other than two security applications of Motorola.  9. The processor is an improved version compared to the previous version, it comes with a Snapdragon 400 chipset and a quad core 1.2 Ghz. The phone does not lag playing the games like asphalt 8, Dead Trigger, Nova 3 etc. There is no extreme heating when playing these high graphic games. The phone gets little warm, which normally would happen.  10.It has a led notification light for all the notification lovers,  11.The disappointment comes when the battery is considered, the battery is same 2070 mah, which should had been at least 2500 to 2700 mah. The only cons of this phone, but as far as an android phone is concerned, we all travel with our chargers and power banks. So its not a big concern.  12.All people concerned about the care centers for Motorola, it has got its centers in all most all states  So, overall I would conclude, the best priced phone for a STOCK Android phone along with the delivery of the Flipkart makes it a SURE SHOT BUY.  Thank you Google and Motorola.... and Flipkart ...",1 of 1 users found this review helpful.,

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,Awesome,"very nice smart phone under 14k. 1. Larger screen: The new Moto G looks almost the same as the old one, but has a slightly bigger screen. The new model has a display larger than the old model by 0.5 inches but with the same screen resolution. The 5-inch 720p display on the new Moto G produces good colours and has satisfactory viewing angles. The larger screen with the same screen resolution means a lower pixel density, but practically, there is little difference for a naked eye to notice. 2. Improved cameras: The Moto G (2nd generation) comes with enhanced cameras. The megapixel count on the new Moto G has been upped from 5 megapixel to 8 megapixel for the primary camera, and 1.3 to 2 megapixel for the front camera. I remember telling people in review of the original Moto G earlier this year that the front camera is okay only for video calling, but not for selfies. But now Motorola has filled that gap with the new model. 3. Additional storage: A significant improvement in the second-gen Moto G is that it offers expandable storage. The addition of a microSD card slot in the second-gen Moto G indicates that Motorola took the feedback seriously. The original Moto G was criticised for not offering additional storage. The company recommends to use a microSD card of not more than 32GB. 4. Dual speakers: Unlike the old Moto G that came with a speaker grill at the back, the new Moto G has dual speakers at the front that produce fairly loud sound in a normal room environment. However, in a noisy atmosphere, it may not sound as powerful. But with earphones plugged in, the phone produces excellent audio results. 5. Cheaper: Motorola in its new Moto G has upped the specs on many fronts, but what it has not increased is its price - in fact, the phone gets slightly cheaper. The new and improved Moto G (16GB) comes at a price of Rs 12,999, which is Rs 1000 cheaper than its predecessor. (The company has not yet launched the 8GB varaint of the new Moto G.)",1 of 1 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,Good phone for those who want pure Vanilla Android Experience,"A decent phone which ticks all the right boxes, I am giving it 5 start because it does which it is suppose to does. But it does pale in comparison to Xiaomi Mi3, but you need to be very-very lucky to get hands on to Mi3 and moreover it is not available right now too. So if anyone who needs a phone under Rs.15000/- can go for it.   Voice clarity is good while on call, speaker voice is good and clear, phone is fast and moreover now you can install SD card in it too.   But I am still waiting for the launch day offer gift email from flipkart. Do not know when they will conduct the draw and when I will be able to avail offer of 50% discount of Moto G accessories.",1 of 1 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,Camera & Storage,"Hi All,  I wanted to quickly call out two of the features that made me buy this phone and after using it, i dont feel let down.   The camera is really good for an 8mp, it brightens the area you focus on and the video recording is very crisp. You will not be disappointed with regard to the camera.  Impressive storage capacity 16gb built-in and i am using a 32gb card, it just seems to feasable i can use it as a storage media and move files since i have extra space.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,Sweet are the fruits of adversity- Finally a budget dream smartfone!!,"Cut your coat according to your cloth...but still get more than what you have thought !!!  When imagination and expectation perfectly matches reality...welcome Moto G2...its a dream come true!!!  If smart phones can't offer basic features like wider screen , expandable memory through microSD, FM , Stereo speakers , pure Vanilla flavour of Android with smooth buttery performance and latest firmware upgrade and still cost up to 30-50k...  These basic features have become a necessity and not just a luxury or something to just brag about unnecessarily.  But if the same is available at economical price without compromising on the premium finish looks..then u know you have made the right decision.  Rather Motorola has made it much simpler by adding more features to Moto G (1st gen) and reducing price of 2nd gen phone by 1000 bucks.  My previous smartfone costed me 23k and I retained it for 2 yrs 8 mnths and ever since I bought it, I have been using Android 2.3- Not a single firmware upgrade I received!! Which was bad !!!  From the past 1 yr I have been looking to buy a much matured smartfone and that too @ economical price.  Finally the wait is over !!!  Screen width is better compared to Moto G (1st gen) and matches that of Nexus 4, Moto X, Samsung Galaxy S4, and Samsung Grande Duos. So feel good abt it.  I wish the in-box accessories also contained a data cable- with USB charging adapter instead of just a single piece of charger.  Overall I would say full satisfaction with the product.... 100 out of 100.",1 of 1 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,4 stars,Really Good Phone. Experience with me so far so good....,"Dear All,  The phone which i ordered but had to wait for so long (almost 3 days to receive) even though ordered at 12.06 AM in midnight, but it was worth the wait.  The phone specifications given are exactly whats being said and it really amazes the way it is.  I wont say the Price is cheaper compared to the quality of the product. It is reasonably priced with the quality of the phone is.  The Pros: 1) 5 inch Screen which is very easy to handle and it is really needed with today's usage of bigger screen, also the screen is Corning Gorilla Glass, which is essential in todays rough treatments with our Phones....lol.. 2) Phones Camera (8 MP as primary and 2 MP as Front for Selfie), it shoots really awesome pics with good resolution of 1280 X 720 and also the Video as well. Front camera works really great with better and brighter pics. 3) Speakers, Dual speakers works really great. The sound is crispy and loud from both the speakers and when used the headset really good and entertaining which will keep you busy listening to music for hours. 4) Light Weight of the phone makes it really easy to handle and its really compact and easy to use with one hand operation (of course u cant play games using one hand) but yes. 5) Dual Sim slot, and very big addition of this phone is its Memory Card expansion slot, which is like a BOON to these category of models of phone with Premium Brands. 6) Better phone in compact size compared to other 4.7 inch screen phone also against its predecessor models of Moto G and Moto X.  The Cons: 1) Biggest and Baddest Con if i say is its Battery Usage, its really a Power Greedy phone (The reason power greedy because last night i charged the phone with 80% and went to sleep keeping the phone beside me, and in the morning when i woke up and saw the battery level is showed me 10% remaining (i slept for almost 6 1/2 hours) so you can imagine the consumption of power is made in those unused hours in the night. 2) The Headset model provided with the phone are really obsolete ones. Everybody wants those noise cancellation with ear buds Headsets. Its really a cheap move made in Motorola quality (well we are even priced likewise), anyone can buy a new separate headsets with those noise cancellation ear buds and which will cost you around 1000 bucks, well it can be compromised. 3) Hmmm....(thinking).........will get back once i find another one......  BUT overall a good phone to buy for those budget conscious people out there. The wait was worth it and i am really satisfied with the product if i compare it with the price i paid..  Enjoy the phone....somethings can be compromised as no phone is perfect and every phone has their own drawbacks but....its good.....",1 of 1 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,No!,"Device has stopped responding after 2 months. It went into a boot loop. There is a solution but the problem shouldnt have arised in the first place because I have used the mobile only carefully, so much so that I havent even dropped it down even once. Disappointed. Editing my rating from 5 to 0. Below was my initial review when I bought it.  I have been using a phone which was costlier with less features. I can certainly feel the difference. This review is after a days use. 1. Looks: Stylish. The front cover ruins the style. I feel like removing it. Apart from that, the finishing is good. Reasonable weight. The speaker protrusions look ugly. Those could have been in the sides. 4.5/5 2. Screen: Looks good. Gorilla alright. Feather touch sensitive. Not sure why Google increased half an inch. I liked Moto G for this. 4.5/5 3. Usability, memory management: No problems so far. With facebook, facebook messenger, chrome, google plus, hangouts, angry birds etc running, I still have 300mb free memory. 4. Audio: Sound is good. Quality not deserving a 5 star rating because I hear some grains. 4.5/5 5. Video: Expected Full hd videos to lag. But they played just fine. 5/5 6. OS: I miss a smaller font and a better resolution. But a better resolution and a better battery would make it Moto X. Google Now is awesome. But have to open it and click the record button to record voice. But voice recognition is amazing. No FM recording or call recording. 4.3/5 Battery performance: Practice every conservation methods like reducing brightness, turn off wifi/data when not in use, motorola assist, and you should be fine for 20-24 hours. Camera: Back cam is superb! So is the front. Misses photo modes. Packaging: Small neat package. An earphone, a charger inside. They could have given a free back cover and a cleaning cloth IMO.  Altogether, Job well done by Google.",1 of 1 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

This is already trademark as excellent :) Display: Quality is very good, tried watching some HD movies and its excellent. SD Card: I have put 32 GB card which is 26 GB full and thought that performance will be reduced but it is running very smooth.   Cons:  Inbuilt headphone is not up to the mark.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,Awesome cell perfect substitute for zenfone 5,"great cell, got an early delivery from flipkart as usual. about the phone: huge 5inch screen looks great even in sunlight, difficult to hold if u have small hands :P difficult to navigate great touch screen very sensitive crisp colors. built quality is great ...... sturdy slim, button position is nice but difficult to press power button and volume rocker as keys are too thin and hard, i think it will improve over time after spending some time with it. sound from 2 front stereo speakers is decent (tried on hd youtube videos) headphones sound is nice for those who love clear and loud sound (tried on bose oe2) can be improved by adding some good music players for bass lovers  os is nice clean and fast gives u a complete nexus experience  stock headphones and charger are not good, charger is of just 550mah so takes time to charge  battery life is good worked for 1.5 day with mixed usage. no usb cable provided so u need to buy 1  rear cam is nice but front cam didnt impress me after using nexus5. fast to respond for google now service(needs to be added externally) hope this review helps",1 of 1 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,4 stars,Good phone Bad accessories and Battery,This is a very nice phone to use. Some of its main advantages are:  1) The phone is really good and looks decent enough.  2) It is fast for the hardware used in the phone credited to the stock android 3) It is very light weight and handy and the back panel is really really good.  4) The back Panel is so good that you don't want to keep it down. 5) The screen is bright enough and the picture quality and sound quality is very decent  The drawback with this phone are: 1) Poor battery backup  2) Stock accessories supplied with the phone.  3) The earphones are normal earphones and are not comfortable to use.  4) The charger is useless. It short circuited my entire house when I plugged it in for the first time because it was too lose to fit in a normal sized power socket.  5) Next it is extremely slow to charge the phone took nearly 6 hours to completely charge it from 11%.  6) Finally don't touch the charger after charging for 2 hours or so.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,MOTO ROCKS... Flipkart too,"I was obsessed to buy this phone.. not this one, but the old moto G. When I went to buy it, it was out of stock.. then I heard 2nd gen is coming.. Booked it on the 6th at midnight and got delivered on 9th (due to holidays and the craphole iam living in). Great effort from flipkart, and about phone,.. You wont get a descent phone with all these features from a reliable company at this rate.. MOTO is a trust. Thats what it makes different from other chinese or Indian manufactures.   Phone is excellent. 5'' display above the 4.5'' of moto g. slightly lower ppi. but u wont recognize with ur naked eyes. CRISP, SHARP and Vibrat but not oversaturated..   Premium buit. Thin, and u have to hold it in ur hand to feel it.. just awesome..  2 Stereo speakers out in front.. provides cristal clear sound without any distortion at max volume..  Attention Grabbing look. seriously. Expecially the black one..  The only problem was I felt was The Charger provided in the pack is crap. earphone is OK, but not in-ear. Battery backup is kind of low.. but lasts a day for me without any problem in normal usage.. CAM is ok.. 8mp cam provides descent clarity images..which also suports panorama, HDR, and 1080p video and slowmotion..

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,Awesome mobile for this price range.,"I had purchased Asus Zenfone 5 few days back and I used it for 5 days. I liked the mobile, but suddenly one day the speakers stopped working and I had to return the product. Flipkart has refunded me the entire amount. But my misfortune, that particular model is out of stock in Flipkart. So I waited for almost one week and Moto G 2nd Gen launched on the last Saturday. Without any doubt I ordered it on the first day and as always Flipkart delivered it to me within no time.   So regarding the service of Flipkart, its always 5/5.   Now coming back to Moto G, awesome phone. The first look itself is stunning, great finish and very much handy. Although the screen size is 5 inch, it doesn't feel big on your hands. The build quality is excellent. The looks are better than Asus Zenfone 5.   As of now I have installed most of the apps that I use frequently and the phone is not lagging. The screen is ultra clear. The camera is good. 8MP is providing a good clarity and even the front cam too. The battery back up is pretty good. Infact the battery backup is far better than Asus Zenfone 5.  The front speakers are a great advantage on the new Moto G. Its loud and clear. The signal strength and wifi capturing is better compared to Zenfone 5.   So I dont regret now. Moto G 2nd Gen is far better than Asus Zenfone 5. Although the Asus UI is better. But Moto G is already updated to latest KitKat version. (preinstalled)   The dual sim functionality is good and the micro sd card slot is definitely a breakthrough compared to the Moto G 1st Gen.   Overall I will give 5 out of 5 for the new Moto G.",1 of 1 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,A must-buy product because it's just Excellent..!!,"This 2nd Generation~Moto G is really a worthy successor of Moto G(old).. with a micro SD card slot, beautiful 5"" inch display, more pixel density and 8MP camera .. Design is also fabulous...  Some hours ago, I was actually thinking to buy Xperia T2 ultra or HTC 816,as my preferences were: 1. More than 5"" screen.. 2. Good camera with flash, with secondary camera.. 3. Dual sim.. 4. Nice touch and HD display.. 5. Durability, good battery backup and cutting-edge technology.. and last but not the least,  6. Brand value and good service support..  Though I intended not to exceed my budget more than 20k, because for me its no use to spend more than 20k only over a phone..  That's why I was in a great dillema..!!  Here, Moto-G(old) was already a blip-blip sensation to me, because of its great performance and pocket-friendly price, but the two main cons were:  1. No external sd card support 2. Small screen  And see, in the 2nd generation phone, these two drawbacks have been totally eradicated.. You can never expect this kind of features in this budgets actually....  Hence, why to wait for? See me... As soon as I had seen the advertisement, I booked it instantly without thinking of a second.... :) :)   CONS: Actually I haven't found any con's in the device so far >> 1. Camera is good at day time but not so premium at low lights.. 2. Battery performance is not out of the world.. 3. The supplied head-phone is a so-so typed..  Mmm, that's all.. Actually there's no any defects I have found yet..!!! Indeed, the smartphone is Double worthy for the money. I will say, just get it without any hesitation.. Really its very nice of this price..  Anyways, I will keep posting my experience with the device in the coming weeks..  And yeah, Flipkart again proved that he's the best....

My views are as follows- 1. Design- Outstanding look..with a sleek back cover and it is easy to hold in both hands( one or both). You must fill that it worth far than it's original price. I prefer the black one..coz it looks fabulous with such a big screen. 2. Performance- Actually I am searching a phone which have the capability of doing multitasking with smoothness and I bet you that till now it has all those which will give you a proper satisfaction. 3. Camera- I must say that it is the thing which makes me WONDER..because I heard reviews before I order. So I knew that it has a very optimized and cool camera with flash. I found it so easy because you can simply click on anywhere on the screen to capture photos. I have also testes the it with flash and I saw that it is very good. 4. Sound- Moto G2 has dual speakers in FRONT which will give you a fabulous soothing experience. While you play any game,videos the sound will not be pampered by your hand. 5. Others- It has a Qualcomm Snapdragon 400 processor which give you a lagfree experience of playing games and doing multitasking. I installed Asphalt 8 and my experience was superb.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,4 stars,First looks at MOTO G (2nd Generation),"Kudos to Flipkart on delivering the phone in 24 hours.  After using phone for couple of days I can say that this is a phone worth buying. 5 inch screen, expandable memory, dual front speakers, 8MP rear camera and 2 MP front camera surely put this in one of the top contenders in Mid range android phone Market.  The issue which I have experienced so far is with the battery. It drains out much faster than the previous version and other android phone in this range. If it could have been a bit better this could have been easily a sensation in android phone market. The other which I could highlight is, it dint come with a data cable but that something I think we can live with.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,The best budget phone from the best company,"Google owned Motorola, is the only company which increases the specs, yet, decreases the price by a thousand rupees. Also, it is the only company which doesn't add lame prefixes and suffixes beside the names of their phones to show the so called 'update of specs'. Pros: 1. The biggest improvement is the build quality of the phone.  I'm blown away by the beauty of this 5-inch ""smart""phone! It looks even better than many of the 20-25k phones, which I totally didn't expect!  2. The battery life (amazingly) lasts more than 'a day and a half' upon moderate usage! 3. The camera is beautiful as well and has lovely settings.  No cons as of now..the phone is just flawless! (which is exactly what we can expect from Google) It is worth every paisa which you pay.

The Phone looks quite big. bigger than moto g. ofcourse it has 5inch display. Accessories included Charger And Earphones. Earphones looks quite cheap. The quality of sound is not that good also. they look like some 300rs cheap earphones Except that the phone looks very stylish and feels very comfortable in hands.  Pros: 1. It looks very good, display is very nice, bright and bit high saturated colours looks great. Videos looks amazing. As the display is of 5 inches, youtube videos looks great and websites show complete content, you dont have to scroll up and down too much.  2. I have noticed that speakers are quite improved from older moto g, voice is very loud and crisp, voice doesnt get crack even if you play a high pitched noisy video on full volume. sound is very stable.  3. It comes with 4.4 kitkat preinstalled. each and every application runs very smoothly even if you have many application running in the background, it doesnt even show 1% lag in scrolling or running any app. I downloaded asphalt 8 in this phone and it runs very very smoothly.  4. Camera on this device is of 8 megapixel. and secondary camera is of 2 megapixel, i must say both the cameras works brilliantly. Hdr mode really works good. i have made a skype call to my friend and outgoing video was really good as my frnd told. i have took many selfies which are quite good looking and doesnt show any lack of quality.  5. Voice calls were very clear and sharp. the audio quality was very good and noise reduction works seemlessly. The people with whom you are talking to can hear you clearly in a noisy environment.  6. Again the main advantage in this new moto g is sd card support, which is amazing. you can use the whole internal memory of phone for installing games and applications and your videos and audio files can be stored in sd card which is ofcourse a great advantage.  7. I have charged this phone 4-5 times till now and it doesnt get heated up. it stays cool even if you play games along with charging. Although it is not suggested to run heavy applications with charging, but who cares lol.  CONS: 1. At first i would say, motorola should consider that the earphones that they are giving with this phone should be good as the headphones are not good, and the sound quality of earphones are not good at all. 2. As soon i turned this phone on, i have connected the device with my wifi to check for software updates n more but whenever i check for updates it says. ""Cant check for updates right now, Try later"" I think there must be some server error of anything. Thats it. i couldnt find anything more as a drawback of a negative point to my experience.  So, i would say the phone is really good. looks smart, stylish with great performance and all the new features. Motorola guarantees the update of L android platform which will be released by google in future.",1 of 1 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,best premium phone under 15k,"this is my first review of any phone ever. i will come straight to the point. if someone want to invest 15000 on a phone and whose parents saying ki beta ye ab last phone hi tera to bhyi moto g 2nd gen is the best to buy.  how it is best? the answer to this is : 1. best built quality you will get in this phone. 2. best android experience at a very good budget. 3. whatever updates launches, it will get it lightning fast. 4. easily understandable. 5. the combination of quadcore 1 gb ram and now 720p with 5 inch screen is the best. 6. some people must be wondering of pixelation, but there is no such thing. 7. camera quality is LAJAWAB of both front and rear camera. 8. and the best part is easy one hand use. 9. the surround sound gives a better quality to the multimedia experience. 10. last but not the least is a good flipkart delivery service.  so whoever wants to buy a phone under 15000 must buy moto g 2nd gen. its the best quality phone ever you will get.",1 of 1 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,Great phone with equally great selling partner,"I ordered the phone within minutes of it launching at 12:00 AM on 6th Sept and paid for a 1 day delivery. Received the phone on 7th Sept as promised. Great service by Flipkart!!!!!  Haven't had a long experimentation with the device however, the Phone handles really well. Primary camera is great, infact better than my digital camera.  The phone feels and fits really good in the hands. It seems lighter than the 149 gms that the specs mention.  I had a little difficulty in removing the back cover for the first time. Thought it would break if i applied any more strength to it. However the user manual that came along helped. In fact they do mention in the manual to be generous in applying a little pressure.   Moto G2 uses a micro sim, so I had to cut my existing mini sim in order to use it in the phone.  Overall a great experience so far with the phone and Flipkart.",1 of 1 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,Good Phone @ good price,"Got the order delivered in 24hours to hyderabad.  Impressions: 1. Performance is pretty good. 2. Stereo sound is a great value. 3. Expansion option is the key missing thing in previous gen which is addressed now.  4. Tried watching a few Google Play movies, the experience is pretty good. 5. When you keep the WiFi and 3G off, the battery is pretty good. Tried charging 100% yesterday night and kept it aside with WiFi connectivity on, for a good 8 hours the battery went down to 65%. Charged it again in the morning and turned off the WiFi, checked that the charge is same after 1hr 30min.  If you want to go with standard, this is the best in this price range.. If you are behind UI, this is not your piece, but you will definitely loose future OS updates if you don't opt for this..  Raghu",1 of 1 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,Motorola gets it right again,"Amazing smartphone from Motorola, that too just at 13k! Finally upgraded from my Motorola Defy+, the experience on the Moto G is much more fluid than on my old phone.  Pros: 1. The screen is sharp and even though it seems huge, its pretty compact for its size. 2. Everything runs smoothly and snappily. No lag whatsoever (so far). 3. The inclusion of a microSD card slot was a big plus for me, as i could transfer everything without even using Moto Migrate, which by itself is a great feature.  4. Camera is a 8MP unit, but low light photos aren't very good. But hey, for this price point it's really great. 5. Another big plus is the bloat-free KitKat. 6. For those concerned about SAR, the SAR values for this phone are below the DoT recommendation.  Cons: Nothing so far, (hopefully) won't find any. One thing to mention is non-removable battery, but it's easy to live with.  So the 2nd gen Moto G ticks all the boxes this time, I was really surprised to see the price of this phone.",1 of 1 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,4 stars,Best to buy..,"It's a amazing product in this range. Though there are others products like Micromax. xolo, lava n all are available as a competitor of this product but I feel this is best of all. It has snapdragon 400 quad core processor which separates this out from all other brands. But there are few things which I didn't like personally and I feel I would have done better: 1. Battery: 2070 mAh compare to 2000 mAh battery in moto g. 2. Dual speaker : Bad idea, as it was destroying the look of set. 3. Front camera is 2MP comapre to 1.6 MP in Moto g. It could be improved too.   Overall I would say, it is a worth buying product. I am rating it 4/5 becoz of battery.",1 of 1 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,4 stars,Moto g 2nd gen is not ground breaking phone like moto g 1st gen but it's all right for the price.......,"3 and half stars to the mobile.....  -1 star for the very bad battery backup & HIGH SAR VALUE -0.5 star for the Camera and quality downgrade  I own a Xiaomi Mi3 , Nexus 7, Spice dream Uno, I have used Galaxy Grand, Xperia ZL, Lumia 525, Canvas 2 colors, Sony LWW n MOTO E.. so I have fair amount of knowledge about these electronic Gadgets and I am a gadgets freak.....  THIS REVIEW IS FOR A NEUTRAL PERSON WHO IS CONFUSED FOR WHICH MOBILE TO CHOSE between Moto g2, Zenfone 5 & Xiaomi  PROS: 1) Its Moto 2) Screen is bright and vivid 3) Best stock android phone under Rs 15000 4) Camera in daylight 5) Nice grip and easy to hold 6) Speakers somewhat  CONS: 1) Battery backup is way too bad compared to moto g 1st gen 2) Camera in night 3) Speakers give cracking noise at maximum volume level 4) Requires too much time for charging  SCREEN : The screen is pretty nice one.. I like its vividness.. Seriously my Mi3 do not have that colour punchiness that this moto g have... No problems with the screen  Performance:-  CAMERA:- Never expected that bad quality from a 13k phone, my canvas 2 colors' 8mp camera was a lot better than this bullshit.. Zenfone 5 has better camera than this one.. The images appear blurry and lost focused..  GAMING:- This is the place where it hits the sweet spot.. It is lil bit better in gaming than Zenfone 5 but no way it could beat Xiaomi Mi3.. You can play any high end game on medium graphics setting without a lag but on high graphics setting it will tend to miss a frame or two..  SPEAKERS AND HEADSET:- These aare loud but while listening on the highest level of sound , they seem to be cracking a little bit.. So they are better than the competition at this price but not the best... And dont even dare to compare them with HTC's stereo speakers.. HTC's speakers are way too superior to those.. Headset output is good but here also nothing beats my Mi3... (I own a sennheiser , skullcandy titan , Mi ear phones and Creative n sony ones..So I do have a little bit of knowledge and experience..)  CALL CLARITY AND ""SAR"" VALUE:- The call clarity is good but not excellent.. The best call clarity among the mobiles I used until now was from Galaxy Grand... When I bought the phone, the SAR values mentioned on flipkart website were 0.55 and 1.01 W/Kg at body and head and suddenly after 2-3 days they changed them and increased the values on their product page.. And I was UNABLE TO LOCATE THE SAR VALUE ON THE BOX AS WELL AS PRODUCT, WHILE ITS MANDATORY FOR THE MANUFACTURERS TO MENTION THE SAR VALUE ON PRODUCT ITSELF ACCORDING TO INDIAN REGULATIONS..I am going to contact flipkart after finishing this review..  I bought that phone for my dad as my dad have strong affection for motorola...  I feel that this is a DOWNGRADE to previous moto G in terms of the QUALITY. My 2-3 friends own gen 1 moto G and boy it feels way too superior to use than this cheap quality product. I own Mi3 and now I understood that really XIAOMI is the best...Mi3 no way feels cheap like this phone. FIRST TIME BUYERS WILL FIND MOTO G 2nd gen TO BE ON PAR, but ones who have habit of changing mobiles like me, will find this phone to be costly in terms of what it offers quality wise.. It should have been 11999 as compared to the competition.  End result:  Friends if you want a real smartphone experience then please wait for Mi4 or go for Zenfone 5 8gb so that you will save 3000 Rs and also will get more value for money.. And lastly, if you have a strong affection for Motorola brand, then only go with Moto G 2nd gen and I promise you after buying it one day you will regret your decision...  UPDATE:- The BATTERY seems to be a major drawback.. My Mi3 lasts me a full day with heavy gaming and wifi and music and internet while with moderate use it lasts a day and half...REALLY XIAOMI THUMBS UP FOR YOU... But this moto G is just ridiculous.. 10% drop in each 25 min? are you kidding? With just 2g internet? What will happen on continuous gaming? I didn't dared to check it then as it requires around 4 hours to get charged as the charger supplied is of 550 mA capacity.. My advice , if you want quick charging, get in touch with moto support and ask them for use of higher capacity charger.. I am going to do it tomorrow.. Surely will post an update.. Thank you guys for reading..!!!  Thank You for reading this.. Will update soon as per my experiences..

However why i chose moto g 2 was only because  1)Moto G is owned by Google so software updates are a guarantee (the most important point)  2)After sales service guarantee  (If i buy a redmi 1s and if for some reason my phone stops working in 2 months..then Xiaomi which is very very new brand in India will surely have incompetent after sales service similar to Micromax.....as this is India after all and incompetent staff will always postpone things and give excuses whereas Motorola has been in India right since the Black and white phone days..,3 of 7 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,2 stars,Blunder from Motorola,"I have multiple issues with my phone as listed below. These are the observations over the period. Battery: Battery is pathetic. It doesn't last more than 2 hours if the Mobile data is switched on. For the volume of the calls I Handle, the battery ends only half day and I have to continuously keep it for charging. Very Hot: Phone is heating up like a hot oven if the call is carried for 5 minutes plus, almost burning my ears. Touch Screen: During charging, the touch screen does not work. All other keys open some other application during charging.  Connectivity: The calls gets disconnected abruptly in-between. Sometime the other person says, he is not able to hear anything. Speakers: The headset is not up to the mark, even the loud speakers are very bad. Call quality is not good and cannot hear anything.  Finally I am very dejected with the battery performance. for the kind of processor speed they have given a absolute useless battery.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,1 star,Amazing phone - a comeback for Motorola but i'll talk about the cons.,"The overall phone looks and also feels like it is made of good quality substance. Back panel is real smooth still providing a good grip to the phone. Therefore, one doesn't feel it is only a 13k phone.   Pros: everyone knows. Personally I feel the best phone with some features which can be corrected.  Cons: Ram is 1 GB, it may not sound like a con but if you add the used RAM and free RAM the total comes to 852 MB which far less than 1GB (1024 MB). (of which more than 350 MB is already occupied RAM so you only get 500 MB for your own use)   I have checked lava iris x1, Rs. 7600 phone provides you with 950 MB in 1GB of RAM so what happened with Moto G. Last time they sold more than a million Moto G so for calculating how many GBs they are saving by saving just 100 MB on one phone.   1000000 x 100 MB = 100000 GB of money (one lakh GB of money)  Second thing:  The scroll down of Moto G is like empty. The most basic thing which one uses is the ""profile"". like the phone sound is on General, Silent, Meeting, Outdoor but it does not have that option neither in the scroll down section nor in the settings.   Normally if you go to the setting => Profile => General, Silent, Meeting or Outdoor and choose one of them to customize the settings.  But in Moto G, Setting=> Sound. No option for Profile, general, Silent, meeting or outdoor. (Big problem)   So the only solution is press the on/off button then change the sound to ""silent"", ""vibrate"" or general"" but no option to edit these settings.   I am playing Asphalt 8 on this phone. Good but sometimes it crashes. So not so good.  Therefore, overall its a 5 star rating phone comparing the price it is available at. Only thing they need to do is correct the problems mentioned above.",3 of 9 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,1 star,Terrible Battery and Touch,"I was excited to receive my new phone, especially as an upgrade from my horribly sluggish and erratic Samsung S-duos.   The phone itself is a good looking piece. I was originally not happy with the 5inch screen, having always preferred the smaller sub 4.5inch phones, but I quickly started to enjoy the extra screen real estate.  My biggest issue with this phone has been the miserable battery performance. I gave it a full charge soon as it arrived and that charge lasted about 6 hours of usage!  Anyway, I then disabled GPS, reduced screen brightness, and now a full overnight charge is lasting me about 7-8 hours at normal usage. It takes only 3 hours to go from 100% to 50% with usage of 3g, a few phone calls, some whatsapp messaging. That just cannot work for my lifestyle!  The other issue that I noticed right from day 1 which frightened me is that the touchscreen sometimes does not respond. Particularly when it is plugged in to charge. Not just does it not respond, but it acts very erratic. So when it is having such an episode, it presses buttons randomly, does not recognize your finger, etc. I have had this happen about 3-4 times in the first two days, though it has not done that again since.   It worries me to have a phone showing such serious issues right in the first week of usage, and makes me not trust it as a device that is so important in my life. I dont know if it is my particular piece that is defective, or whether this model itself is a bad choice.   I am returning my phone for these reasons. 8 hours of battery is just not acceptable for a lifestyle on the move. Too bad, coz I was starting to really like the phone. :(",2 of 5 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,1 star,Highly disappointed - both with the phone and Flipkart,The battery is really bad. Doesn't even last a full day and that too with no gaming or calls or messages! During charging the charger heats up like one has kept it on a gas stove!!!  And like one of the user has already pointed out - (AND I FACED THE SAME ISSUE TOO) I got a sealed moto g2 box but upon opening it I was bit shocked to see the plastic sheet of phone screen was bit like forged second hand set kind of work. There was no motorola's M mark on it plus the sheet was lifted a bit plus their was couple dirt bubbles on the set. Am also not sure if motorola or flipkart will be sure even about which lot is fresh. it might be some returned repackaged set.   Update to earlier review above -   Got the handset replaced on 26/11/14. And thankfully this time it was a fresh piece. Gotta watch its battery performance now. The charger is still heating up though!!   Update after a week of using the replaced handset -  The battery is VERY BAD. It doesn't even last 24 hrs!! This phone deserves a ZERO STAR RATING.,1 of 2 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,1 star,Motorola Ruined a good phone in the second generation,"I bought this phone keeping in mind the huge success and the flawless experience of the First generation Moto G. but, this time Motorola has just spoiled a really great device.  Problems:  1. The touch sensitivity is very poor and many a times stops working completely and you have to reboot the phone to get back to normal 2. The phone freezes a lot and performance is laggy and slow 3. The dual speakers heat up a lot and you can't touch the earpiece(one of the speakers) after playing music out loud for more than 15-20 minutes 4. The RAM is too less and only around 300 MB is free at any point which is insufficient for multitasking and apps keep reloading  Lot of other small problems but these are the main ones. i would strictly recommend against buying this phone. Don't get carried away with your impression of the first gen device as i did.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,2 stars,Moto G Buy but beware of the battery life,"I liked to new Moto G but the only drawback is the battery, it does not give you entire day with 3G on. Moto G should have given at least 2500 mah battery capacity. Also the display should had been 1080p and not 720p resolution. So overall I would rather go with someother brand then this one.",1 of 2 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,1 star,Disappointed with the Product; Happy with Flipkart !,"While the phone is really good to hold, works well, has fast navigation, good sound etc. etc. but you really cant live with such defects which I faced. Motorola should pump up its quality function to avoid such issues. I bought this phone with lot of excitement but was disappointed completely. Since I got 2 replacement i.e. I used 3 different devices, I find it hard to digest this as a one-off case.  My experience is as follows:  Lot of positive reviews on the Flipkart and numerous media reports strongly recommending MOTO G (2nd Gen) as one of the best devices in its price range made the purchase decision easy for me.  22nd Sept | Phone reached us in no time through the one-day delivery option.   29th Sept | The phone worked flawlessly for a week before the display conked off. Immediately a return/replacement request was filed with Flipkart which was addressed and accepted immediately and the replacement phone reached us the very next day. The return request was denied at this point in time by Flipkart and I cannot complain as this is mentioned on the Moto G page on the Flipkart site.  7th Oct | During a weeks usage of this phone I could sense that the screen has yellow tint on the screen. In fact it was clearly evident when the brightness was set as low. The screen display quality was really disturbing specially because the phone is known for its display. Hence I again requested for a replacement/return. This was also entertained and accepted immediately. Plus I was offered to return the phone by the Flipkart executive, however I chose to give them another chance hoping that this is a one-off case. I asked for a 2nd replacement.   20th Oct | Since I was travelling, I requested Flipkart executive to deliver the 2nd replacement on the 20th. . When I got it I noticed the similar issue on the screen of this device as well. Only difference being that on the previous phone, the entire screen was yellow and in the 2nd replacement phone the bottom half of the screen was yellow. I browsed through the net to find that the issue is known and lot of people are facing it.  21st Oct | I requested for an immediate return and finally pick-up happened on the 22nd and soon after I got the refund as well. Thanks to Flipkart for the same.  I give a rating of 1 on the scale of 5 to the phone. However good a phone may be, may have the best of specifications, a single factor can still make it unusable.   Flipkart gets 4 out of 5. You could have got 5 on 5 if you have provisions of entertaining requests on the delivery date and time. I faced a lot of issues when the 2nd replacement was in transit and I contacted your team through phone/mail multiple times to request for a delivery before a certain day and your team gave nothing but false promises. I have noticed that you team has no influence over this and product gets delivered only as per the schedule mentioned on the website. This is an area where you can improve.",1 of 2 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,4 stars,Good Budget Phone,"Before I start my review, let me mention that I have past experience of using Samsung Galaxy Core, Micromax Canvas 2 and now a days I am using Samsung Galaxy Grand 2. I ordered Moto G 2nd Generation on Mon, 8th Sep'14 for my wife as her birthday gift on 18th Seo'14. At the time of placing order it showed that faster delivery is not available in Guwahati, so, will be delivered by 19th. I requested Filpkart to deliver it on or before 18th. Thanks to Mr. Kethan S from Customer Support of Flipkart who confirmed me that it will be delivered on or before 18th.   Flipkart kept their promise and Delhivery delivered the Moto G2 on 18th Sep'14. Many many thanks to Flipkart and Delhivery.  Now coming to the product, Motorola has done a great job. The build quality is solid. I felt the premium build quality of Moto G2 as soon as I hold it. The curved design made it one step ahead from the other brands.  Pros: 1. Good build 2. Good camera 3. Good battery life (I charged it upto 100% yesterday and still its showing 60%) 4. Gorila Glass helps to use it without screen protector 6. Great display 7. Front speakers are loud n clear 8. No network or call drops 9. Around 12GB available internal memory 10. 5 inch easy to handle with Single hand  Cons: 1. Stock Android 4.4.4 UI is not that much user friendly compared to Samsung Touchwiz UI. So many user friendly shortcuts and options are not available which can be found even in low budget Samsung Android phones.  2.The charger provided with this phone is very weak and takes a bit amount of time to charge the phone. 3. Headphone is not good. 4. File Manager not found. You have to download third party file manager app. 5. My phone color is black and I got white colored headset. It looks awkward when I wear headset. 6. FM radio not playable through the speakers  Overall a great buy from Flipkart for dual sim functionality, great looks and functionality at budget. Since it has few cons... I gave four stars",1 of 2 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

The finish is not proper.   Also there are few other issues, like volume button on the right is very hard and jamming. Touch is also lagging a bit. Battery is taking long time to charge.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,2 stars,Poor Battery and functionality,"The delivery of flipkart is awesome but on using the phone for a couple of days I discovered the following bugs :-  1. WORST BATTERY EVER :- to save cost MOTO has designed one of the worst batteries which goes out in less than 6 hours 2. WORST CHARGER :- It takes 5 hours to charge the phone, are u kidding me ? I bought another charger to see if atleast that charges faster but no, the serial bus of MOTO G is different. 3. Functionality issues like shortcuts, UI are way too primitive than 2012 phones, you really have to click 2-3 times to get to one feature 4. Data transfer is a big pain, firstly they dont give you a USB chord to transfer songs/videos and to make it worse, if you use your normal cable, there is a big issue of drivers and copying files is very unpredictable  I have requested for a product return as I invested 13000 so that i dont have to keep this phone plugged to my charger ALL DAY.

It would take a lot of time to get charged to 100 % and the same will be discharged to like 50% in a few hours even though the phone is not at all used (in stand by). After 50 % charge is left on the device the battery will hold on to some time. when the battery is fully charged the discharging is taking place like a count down, whether you use the phone or not. I am not sure whether this issue is because of the stock charger or with the battery but i am strongly request flipkart to do something in this regard as the features of this outstanding phone should not fade away in lime light because of the battery back up.",1 of 2 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

This is called Flipkart Monopoly by selling all the stock of earlier edition & for same price just rise by Rs.1000 introduce new edition of Moto G making people fool.  Flipkart i think earn Rs.4000 to Rs.5000 per phone. Motorola Moto G Production cost of 1phone may be Rs.8000. Solid way to earn profit & in between that also offering various schemes like cash back on Visa cards etc. to make people fool & sold the product.

Pros moto g:  5"" display (if you like a bigger one) timely android upgrade trusted brand expandable only upto 32gb  Pros of redmi 1s: 4.7"" screen ( this is the best optimized size) better camera quality, this has more clear image than moto g  better resolution can record videos at resolution 1080 which is not the case with moto g better battery backup, since it has 4.7' screen and both the batteries are almost same. removable battery which is a added advantage. expandable memory upto 64gb fresh UI -> MIUI half the price of moto g  Hence decided to go with redmi 1s.

THINGS TO DO AFTER BUYING THIS PHONE? 1) Go to Settings>>About Phone and tap 5 times on Build number to enable developer mode. 2) Go to Settings>>Developer options and Select runtime: Use ART. This will help you save more ram and longer battery life. Doing this will ask you restart the phone.. it may take some times depends on the number of apps you have installed. (You will not lose any of your apps.) 3) Once ART runtime mode is enabled, again navigate to Settings>>Developer options and UNcheck Don't keep activities.. This will help you if you do multitasking. Note: Do not use ART runtime if you restart your phone very frequently as everytime it will take time to optimize apps on the startup. 4) Disable System Apps if you don't use them. For me these includes: Drive, Email, Gmail, Google Korean Keyboard, Google Pinyin Input, Google Play Books, Google Play Games, Google Play Movies, Google Play Newsstand, Google+, Maps, Motorola Alert, Motorola Migrate. Note: You may install K-9 mail as default mail app. i am sure you are gonna love it. Dont forget to disable sync and notifications.  KNOWN ISSUES AND SOLUTIONS 1) This phone lacks an option for WCDMA ONLY mode. To force stay on 3g network, Download ""NETWORK"" by ""PHILIPP MANGELOW"" from play store and select WCDMA ONLY. 2) Notification Bar does not contain quick toggle and it redirects you to the setting menu. To enable quick toggle in notification bar, Download ""NOTIFICATION TOGGLE"" by ""J4VELIN"" from Play Store and customize it according to your needs. There is an option for radio toggles too, so if you install this app then you do not need to install NETWORK from play store. 3) If your music sound goes wired on full volume then use 320 KBPS Original Music files only and / or Go to Settings>>Sound>>Audio Effect and Turn it OFF.  TIPS AND TRICKS 1) Before installing any application, make sure you read all the permission ask by the app developer. 2) Never ever install TrueCaller on your phone because this app sends your contacts to their server and voids the privacy. 3) Always keep Notifications OFF for any app, this will help you save more ram and longer battery backup. You can do it in two ways: (i) Go to particular app>>settings turn all notification off. (ii) Go to Settings>>Apps, select app and UNcheck Show Notifications. 4) Keep your WiFi and Data OFF when you don't need it. 5) Do not install Facebook App and FB Messenger as they will eat more than 110mb of ram.  WHY MOTO G (2ND GEN) AND WHY NOT ASUS ZENFONE 5 (16GB) 1) OPERATING SYSTEM: Moto G Comes with Android 4.4.4 KitKat and is Upgradable to Android 5.0 Lollipop or later for 1.5 years. ASUS ZenFone 5 comes with Android 4.3 JellyBean and is Upgradable to 4.4.2. An update from ASUS confirms that Lollipop will arrive later in June 2015 but no guarantee. 2) PROCESSOR: Moto G Runs on 1.2 GHZ SnapDragon ARM based Processor, On the other hand ASUS runs on 1.6 GHZ Intel x86 based processor. The point here is most of the (99%)android apps are designed to run on an ARM based cpu. 3) RAM: Moto G has 1 GB of RAM and runs on simple stock android and contains no junkware. ASUS has 2GB of ram in which 800 MB is already used by the heavy UI and preinstalled apps that can not be disabled. 4) UI: ASUS wins in the case of User Interface because its ZEN UI is very very beautiful and user friendly. Moto G has Simple stock UI. 5) GPU: Moto is FAR Better in gaming than the Asus as its contains Aderno GPU.  FLIPKART SERVICE Paid Extra 90 Rupees and Get phone after 2 day. POOR SERVICE.  So friends, if you find this review useful then spread this review so that all the users of Moto G can take advantage.",94% of 182 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,Asus zenfone 5 vs Moto g 2nd gen vs Xiomi Redmi 1s,"Writing this review after using all the three phone  I had bought the zenfone 5 just after the launch but after one month of continuous use I realized that it had some fault in the hearing speaker. I checked with my friends zenfone and it was perfectly OK. Flipkart was courteous enough to refund the same. After that I bought moto g new edition. I am not writing the specs comparison which you can get easily at Flipkart and its deceiving sometimes as on paper they may claim heaven but what matters is real performance. I am writing this one for helping the confused buyers considering the user experience and the things which are not compared/ highlighted in online reviews but matters a lot.  Design and build:  Both have the good build quality but I liked the moto g as it feels comfortable to hold. moto g is very soft on hand and for the same screen size its dimensions are less and thus easy to operate. Zenfone has a bigger form factor and the design is edgy so while holding in one hand or while talking its edges hurt. Xiomi Redmi 1s is old school basic design with solid feel but @160g weight its too heavy to carry around.  Display:  Though on paper both have the same specs but the colors are more stunning and vivid on zenfone 5 it feels like an amoled screen. Moto g looks a bit washed out. Xiomi Redmi 1s on paper has the same HD screen but it has a yellowish tinge in the screen and black is not true black as in Moto G so colour contrast is not that impressive.  Processor: All the three have equally powerful processor not much difference.  Multitasking:  Though moto g has the less ram but as it runs vanilla android its requirement is also less so again it's equal in both and I did not find any lag in both.  User experience: zenui wins here as it gives many enhancements over the stock android but after android l upgrade on moto g the situation will completely change. Xiomi Redmi 1s MIUI is like a copy of iOS with lots of improvements but I didnt like personally as it doesnt look modern.  Gaming: I played heavy games like Injustice: Gods among us, Asphalt:8 & Real Racing on both the phones. In this aspect the Zenfone 5 is clear winner as you can play almost all the games in best graphics setting without lag but again be ready keep a charger beside phone as it will eat your battery at approx 10% per 15 min.  If someone is expecting a great gaming experience in Moto g is not for you the above games runs flawlessly on Moto G at medium graphics setting. At high graphics setting the games may close in between due to low RAM but again Battery performance is much better here its 10% per 30 min. Pls dont expect Xiomi Redmi 1s for heavy games it will get so hot that you may not be able to hold it. Camera:  Camera in both the devices are equally good but the default camera app on moto g is pathetic. I installed Google camera app and its great.  Battery: This is the biggest con for zenfone 5. I had to carry my charger all the time. The battery management of Intel processors is still novice. I was traveling on train with GPS on as I was traveling for the first time to this place and the battery ran down from 99% to 30% in just 4.5 hours and still 2 hours journey left. What's the use of such phone which doesn't help in such situations. moto g is satisfactory in this aspect if not great as Qualcomm professors are frugal. Xiomi Redmi 1s is OK in its price range but not great think that it consumes more battery due to heating of the device even on smallest of applications.  Sound: The sound in the Zenfone 5 is really very low and in this aspect the Moto G is way ahead. Moto G is a great media device. Xiomi Redmi 1s s OK in its price range.  The discission completely depends on buyer but for me the battery life is more important compared to any other features so I prefer moto g although a bit pricey.  Note: Xiomi Redmi 1s has improved in the heating department after the latest update from company but it still gets heated up. it took 3 updates from the company with each apprx 30 mb, 300 mb & 512 mb respectively. So make sure you have a broad band to be able to install these updates.",91% of 1022 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,Moto G..best in class..Amazing product,"Hello everyone ....I ordered Moto G on 8th September 2014....it was dispatched with fedex and bad service was a part of my life..from there on......i got the order delivered to me on 15th september that too after i decided to go to fedex outlet in goa and took it from them otherwise it would have been more two days for me...bad service by flipkart.. So after i got my product i first charged it to 100% and kept it for 8hours charging i dont know whether that helps but someone had told me that first time longer charging helps... To tell u the fact the design of the phone is awesome....its confirtable in hand....5"" screen looks big but handy though.....when i first kept for charging i used the samsung charger which i had becoz i had seen reviews abt the moto charger getting heated..but to my suprise the phone started giving some smell i was not sure what was that...but when i changed my charger to moto charger ...the smell jus went.....so if anyone is having isssues of smell from the phone while charging please use moto charger ...the camera is superb good clicks outside...i tried gaming and other apps but the phone has not issues with heating or any other flaws...there are no flaws in this machine.....its born to lead u...and it will.....amazing touch and also display....crisp and bright....the front two speakers look a bit weird but its ok....cz the design of the phone kills it....many people had issues regarding sim card slots...but i found both my slots very much functional and with good network catch...the phone is fast ...smooth...u can call it ""makkhan"".. The Moto migrate is amazing ...it made my migration of contacts from symbian to moto quiet easy .....in just 4-5 steps...the front cam is not bad though....  Now the thing what ur waiting for....and everybody who found it a glitch ..is the battery backup...  i use the phone full day from 9am... i use whatsapp...facebook.....viber...Hike...all on 3G ....a bit of gaming... till 6pm ..m on 3G...after i reach home....i shift to wifi...but my apps are continuously ON.... with so much of usage....i get a backup of minimum 12hrs.....with 20% battery still remaining....so u can get an idea about what u can expect if you are a user like me...  there are no heating issues with the phone which i am happy about....no lags on call neither on camera...  overall awesome phone....... those who are thnking abt buying it..go for it....if u get a faulty piece do replace it and u will get what u want...",91% of 168 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,A good mid-range Android phone.,"Ordered last night just past 12 and received at 2:30 PM today! Fantastic delivery. Couldn't keep up with the tracker's speed :)  Still exploring, will update more later.  Here are the first impressions -   1. Screen: Nice, crisp and vivid, but only 720p. With Snapdragon 400, I guess 720p makes more sense than 1080p. It is 5 inches in size but feels compact and usable in single hand. 2. Performance: Android 4.4.4 comes pre-installed. Lag-free so far. Runs Riptide GP pretty well. Should run all games meant for Snapdragon 400. MS Office, Facebook and Google Drive all work fast and fine.  3. Sound: The front dual speakers are awesome. Very nice sound. None of the other Motos (E/G/X) so far had this kind of fidelity.  4. Camera: 8 MP main cam & 2 MP front. Very good snaps so far both indoors and outdoors. Got only 20 mins to experiment :) 5. Call quality: 2 mics with noise cancellation and a loud speaker! Feels good. 6. Micro SD Slot: This is the greatest inclusion. Moto G sorely missed that. Good option. 7. What else do you want? :) C'mon guys what else do you expect from a phone at this price point? It won't cook your meals or solve your financial problems. Use it practically. It's a good deal. The Moto + Google combination is working out for the masses!  Will get back after a week or so with extended usage report.",88% of 724 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,Bang For Your Buck,"With Xiaomi phones not made available for general public with their show off flash sales, I decided to purchase the Moto G(2nd gen). This handset from the time of launch is still readily available on flipkart :)  I liked the handset look, feel and overall aspects. The Stereo speakers, Camera and additional storage are the biggest upgrades over the previous phones.  The only con in this phone is the very average battery life. If one is a regular user of the phone for browsing, whatsapp, etc several times a day I feel the battery will drain out in about 8-10 hours.   Overall very much satisfied with this phone for a price of Rs 12,999/- and one can buy on demand and not wait for your lucky chance every Tuesday.",96% of 45 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,1 star,Worst customer service and demanding extra money for repairing from Motorola service center Pune-India,"Hi Everyone,  I am initiating this, to appraise you all of the difficulties, Worst Customer Service, demanding 80% phone cost for repairing and wrong suggestions, I got from PC Support Motorola Service center,Pune and Live Assistance of Motorola India.  Recently I have purchased Motorola 2nd Gen mobile from from flipkart. It was working awesome but unfortunately few drops of the water goes inside the phone from the bottom area and it's switched off. So I visited to Motorola service center Pune to repair my mobile. [PC Support]  However I have faced worst customer service from Motorola and following difficulties I have faced in the service center:  1. They opened back panel of my phone and told me about liquid damage, I agree with them and said please repair my mobile. Then the lady who checked my phone said, ""You have to pay 80% mobile phone cost to repair the phone."". It was totally hilarious and shocking for me because they asked me 80% of money of my phone without checking the problem.  2. After I refused to pay them the lady said please repair your mobile from local mobile shop if they can. [This part was very disappointed to me because how can any authorized service center can tell any customer to go unauthorized local shop to repair your mobile. Is this Motorola company provide service after sell in India?]  3. As my phone is new and I don't want to test or experiment on my phone from any local mobile repair shop, I told her, ""Could you please at least check my phone and provide me details which part in the phone is damage exactly?"" Then she asked me to pay 250 Rs to check my phone and said ""We will call you about problem in 4-5 days."" I said OK and asked them about written detailed report of what you checked and which parts are exactly damaged then she again refused and said, ""Our technical guy will call you that's it."" I was very frustrated and paid them 250 Rs to see what they can tell me about damage of my phone.   4. After experiencing this worst service from Motorola service center, I tried to chat with Motorola online chat assistance. I told him what I have faced problem in the service center and asked him, Is it really true, Motorola asked to his customer to pay 80% phone cost to repair mobile phone? But he was not able to answer my questions correctly.  Such kind of unprofessional suggestion and demanding money 80% money without checking problem was not expected out of a authorized service center of Motorola.  How can people will pay Motorola 80% mobile cost to repair faulty phone?  Also, I contacted Flipkart about this problem, however Flipkart Customer care said, ""It's not our problem. Please contact Motorola Service center. We are not responsible after sale service.""  Now I don't know whats is going to happen with my mobile. So I request everyone, Flipkart and Motorola cheating with customers as they are not providing good service after sales. So please don't buy any Moto phone.

While decided to buy a new phone i was so confused between the Moto G (2nd Gen) and ASUS ZenFone 5 (16GB).

The discission completely depends on buyer but for me the battery life is more important compared to any other features so I prefer moto g although a bit pricey.  Note: Xiomi Redmi 1s has improved in the heating department after the latest update from company but it still gets heated up. it took 3 updates from the company with each apprx 30 mb, 300 mb & 512 mb respectively. So make sure you have a broad band to be able to install these updates.",91% of 1022 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,A good mid-range Android phone.,"Ordered last night just past 12 and received at 2:30 PM today! Fantastic delivery. Couldn't keep up with the tracker's speed :)  Still exploring, will update more later.  Here are the first impressions -   1. Screen: Nice, crisp and vivid, but only 720p. With Snapdragon 400, I guess 720p makes more sense than 1080p. It is 5 inches in size but feels compact and usable in single hand. 2. Performance: Android 4.4.4 comes pre-installed. Lag-free so far. Runs Riptide GP pretty well. Should run all games meant for Snapdragon 400. MS Office, Facebook and Google Drive all work fast and fine.  3. Sound: The front dual speakers are awesome. Very nice sound. None of the other Motos (E/G/X) so far had this kind of fidelity.  4. Camera: 8 MP main cam & 2 MP front. Very good snaps so far both indoors and outdoors. Got only 20 mins to experiment :) 5. Call quality: 2 mics with noise cancellation and a loud speaker! Feels good. 6. Micro SD Slot: This is the greatest inclusion. Moto G sorely missed that. Good option. 7. What else do you want? :) C'mon guys what else do you expect from a phone at this price point? It won't cook your meals or solve your financial problems. Use it practically.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,1 star,Worst customer service and demanding extra money for repairing from Motorola service center Pune-India,"Hi Everyone,  I am initiating this, to appraise you all of the difficulties, Worst Customer Service, demanding 80% phone cost for repairing and wrong suggestions, I got from PC Support Motorola Service center,Pune and Live Assistance of Motorola India.  Recently I have purchased Motorola 2nd Gen mobile from from flipkart. It was working awesome but unfortunately few drops of the water goes inside the phone from the bottom area and it's switched off. So I visited to Motorola service center Pune to repair my mobile. [PC Support]  However I have faced worst customer service from Motorola and following difficulties I have faced in the service center:  1. They opened back panel of my phone and told me about liquid damage, I agree with them and said please repair my mobile. Then the lady who checked my phone said, ""You have to pay 80% mobile phone cost to repair the phone."". It was totally hilarious and shocking for me because they asked me 80% of money of my phone without checking the problem.  2. After I refused to pay them the lady said please repair your mobile from local mobile shop if they can. [This part was very disappointed to me because how can any authorized service center can tell any customer to go unauthorized local shop to repair your mobile. Is this Motorola company provide service after sell in India?]  3. As my phone is new and I don't want to test or experiment on my phone from any local mobile repair shop, I told her, ""Could you please at least check my phone and provide me details which part in the phone is damage exactly?"" Then she asked me to pay 250 Rs to check my phone and said ""We will call you about problem in 4-5 days."" I said OK and asked them about written detailed report of what you checked and which parts are exactly damaged then she again refused and said, ""Our technical guy will call you that's it."" I was very frustrated and paid them 250 Rs to see what they can tell me about damage of my phone.   4. After experiencing this worst service from Motorola service center, I tried to chat with Motorola online chat assistance. I told him what I have faced problem in the service center and asked him, Is it really true, Motorola asked to his customer to pay 80% phone cost to repair mobile phone? But he was not able to answer my questions correctly.  Such kind of unprofessional suggestion and demanding money 80% money without checking problem was not expected out of a authorized service center of Motorola.  How can people will pay Motorola 80% mobile cost to repair faulty phone?  Also, I contacted Flipkart about this problem, however Flipkart Customer care said, ""It's not our problem. Please contact Motorola Service center. We are not responsible after sale service.""  Now I don't know whats is going to happen with my mobile. So I request everyone, Flipkart and Motorola cheating with customers as they are not providing good service after sales. So please don't buy any Moto phone.

So asked flipkart to take the product back and either replace / refund. Coz of non-usage of product, not commenting on the features and other stuff.  I have been following up with flipkart.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,"Moto G (2nd Gen) Hidden Features, Known Issues & Solutions","First of all I would like to confirm that You made a right choice if you have bought this phone.  While decided to buy a new phone i was so confused between the Moto G (2nd Gen) and ASUS ZenFone 5 (16GB).  After doing a lot of research online i found Asus ZenFone 5 Battery is not good when you use 3G Internet or Play Games.  So Here I am not going to share the specification of this phone rather i will focus on some hidden features and known issues and their solutions.  FOR YOUR INFORMATION: 1) This phone support 3g network in only SIM Slot 1. 2) No File Manager installed (You need to download ES File Explorer from Play Store) 3) Simple Stock UI result in Smooth performance. 4) No Lags at all. 5) Guaranteed Android and Security Updates for 18 Months. 6) Battery average (12 Hour Backup with wifi and 3g network on, 1 hour of internet surfing, 30 minutes of gaming, 1 hour of whatsapp, 2 hour of music, some phone calls and 10 minutes of camera use). 7) Fast Startup & ShutDown. 8) Premium Look and Display.  THINGS TO DO AFTER BUYING THIS PHONE? 1) Go to Settings>>About Phone and tap 5 times on Build number to enable developer mode. 2) Go to Settings>>Developer options and Select runtime: Use ART. This will help you save more ram and longer battery life. Doing this will ask you restart the phone.. it may take some times depends on the number of apps you have installed. (You will not lose any of your apps.) 3) Once ART runtime mode is enabled, again navigate to Settings>>Developer options and UNcheck Don't keep activities.. This will help you if you do multitasking. Note: Do not use ART runtime if you restart your phone very frequently as everytime it will take time to optimize apps on the startup. 4) Disable System Apps if you don't use them. For me these includes: Drive, Email, Gmail, Google Korean Keyboard, Google Pinyin Input, Google Play Books, Google Play Games, Google Play Movies, Google Play Newsstand, Google+, Maps, Motorola Alert, Motorola Migrate. Note: You may install K-9 mail as default mail app. i am sure you are gonna love it. Dont forget to disable sync and notifications.  KNOWN ISSUES AND SOLUTIONS 1) This phone lacks an option for WCDMA ONLY mode. To force stay on 3g network, Download ""NETWORK"" by ""PHILIPP MANGELOW"" from play store and select WCDMA ONLY. 2) Notification Bar does not contain quick toggle and it redirects you to the setting menu. To enable quick toggle in notification bar, Download ""NOTIFICATION TOGGLE"" by ""J4VELIN"" from Play Store and customize it according to your needs. There is an option for radio toggles too, so if you install this app then you do not need to install NETWORK from play store. 3) If your music sound goes wired on full volume then use 320 KBPS Original Music files only and / or Go to Settings>>Sound>>Audio Effect and Turn it OFF.  TIPS AND TRICKS 1) Before installing any application, make sure you read all the permission ask by the app developer. 2) Never ever install TrueCaller on your phone because this app sends your contacts to their server and voids the privacy. 3) Always keep Notifications OFF for any app, this will help you save more ram and longer battery backup. You can do it in two ways: (i) Go to particular app>>settings turn all notification off. (ii) Go to Settings>>Apps, select app and UNcheck Show Notifications. 4) Keep your WiFi and Data OFF when you don't need it. 5) Do not install Facebook App and FB Messenger as they will eat more than 110mb of ram.  WHY MOTO G (2ND GEN) AND WHY NOT ASUS ZENFONE 5 (16GB) 1) OPERATING SYSTEM: Moto G Comes with Android 4.4.4 KitKat and is Upgradable to Android 5.0 Lollipop or later for 1.5 years. ASUS ZenFone 5 comes with Android 4.3 JellyBean and is Upgradable to 4.4.2. An update from ASUS confirms that Lollipop will arrive later in June 2015 but no guarantee. 2) PROCESSOR: Moto G Runs on 1.2 GHZ SnapDragon ARM based Processor, On the other hand ASUS runs on 1.6 GHZ Intel x86 based processor. The point here is most of the (99%)android apps are designed to run on an ARM based cpu. 3) RAM: Moto G has 1 GB of RAM and runs on simple stock android and contains no junkware. ASUS has 2GB of ram in which 800 MB is already used by the heavy UI and preinstalled apps that can not be disabled. 4) UI: ASUS wins in the case of User Interface because its ZEN UI is very very beautiful and user friendly. Moto G has Simple stock UI. 5) GPU: Moto is FAR Better in gaming than the Asus as its contains Aderno GPU.  FLIPKART SERVICE Paid Extra 90 Rupees and Get phone after 2 day. POOR SERVICE.  So friends, if you find this review useful then spread this review so that all the users of Moto G can take advantage.",94% of 182 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,Asus zenfone 5 vs Moto g 2nd gen vs Xiomi Redmi 1s,"Writing this review after using all the three phone  I had bought the zenfone 5 just after the launch but after one month of continuous use I realized that it had some fault in the hearing speaker. I checked with my friends zenfone and it was perfectly OK. Flipkart was courteous enough to refund the same. After that I bought moto g new edition. I am not writing the specs comparison which you can get easily at Flipkart and its deceiving sometimes as on paper they may claim heaven but what matters is real performance. I am writing this one for helping the confused buyers considering the user experience and the things which are not compared/ highlighted in online reviews but matters a lot.  Design and build:  Both have the good build quality but I liked the moto g as it feels comfortable to hold. moto g is very soft on hand and for the same screen size its dimensions are less and thus easy to operate. Zenfone has a bigger form factor and the design is edgy so while holding in one hand or while talking its edges hurt. Xiomi Redmi 1s is old school basic design with solid feel but @160g weight its too heavy to carry around.  Display:  Though on paper both have the same specs but the colors are more stunning and vivid on zenfone 5 it feels like an amoled screen. Moto g looks a bit washed out. Xiomi Redmi 1s on paper has the same HD screen but it has a yellowish tinge in the screen and black is not true black as in Moto G so colour contrast is not that impressive.  Processor: All the three have equally powerful processor not much difference.  Multitasking:  Though moto g has the less ram but as it runs vanilla android its requirement is also less so again it's equal in both and I did not find any lag in both.  User experience: zenui wins here as it gives many enhancements over the stock android but after android l upgrade on moto g the situation will completely change. Xiomi Redmi 1s MIUI is like a copy of iOS with lots of improvements but I didnt like personally as it doesnt look modern.  Gaming: I played heavy games like Injustice: Gods among us, Asphalt:8 & Real Racing on both the phones. In this aspect the Zenfone 5 is clear winner as you can play almost all the games in best graphics setting without lag but again be ready keep a charger beside phone as it will eat your battery at approx 10% per 15 min.  If someone is expecting a great gaming experience in Moto g is not for you the above games runs flawlessly on Moto G at medium graphics setting. At high graphics setting the games may close in between due to low RAM but again Battery performance is much better here its 10% per 30 min. Pls dont expect Xiomi Redmi 1s for heavy games it will get so hot that you may not be able to hold it. Camera:  Camera in both the devices are equally good but the default camera app on moto g is pathetic. I installed Google camera app and its great.  Battery: This is the biggest con for zenfone 5. I had to carry my charger all the time. The battery management of Intel processors is still novice. I was traveling on train with GPS on as I was traveling for the first time to this place and the battery ran down from 99% to 30% in just 4.5 hours and still 2 hours journey left. What's the use of such phone which doesn't help in such situations. moto g is satisfactory in this aspect if not great as Qualcomm professors are frugal. Xiomi Redmi 1s is OK in its price range but not great think that it consumes more battery due to heating of the device even on smallest of applications.  Sound: The sound in the Zenfone 5 is really very low and in this aspect the Moto G is way ahead. Moto G is a great media device. Xiomi Redmi 1s s OK in its price range.  The discission completely depends on buyer but for me the battery life is more important compared to any other features so I prefer moto g although a bit pricey.  Note: Xiomi Redmi 1s has improved in the heating department after the latest update from company but it still gets heated up. it took 3 updates from the company with each apprx 30 mb, 300 mb & 512 mb respectively.

[This part was very disappointed to me because how can any authorized service center can tell any customer to go unauthorized local shop to repair your mobile. Is this Motorola company provide service after sell in India?]  3. As my phone is new and I don't want to test or experiment on my phone from any local mobile repair shop, I told her, ""Could you please at least check my phone and provide me details which part in the phone is damage exactly?"" Then she asked me to pay 250 Rs to check my phone and said ""We will call you about problem in 4-5 days."" I said OK and asked them about written detailed report of what you checked and which parts are exactly damaged then she again refused and said, ""Our technical guy will call you that's it."" I was very frustrated and paid them 250 Rs to see what they can tell me about damage of my phone.   4. After experiencing this worst service from Motorola service center, I tried to chat with Motorola online chat assistance. I told him what I have faced problem in the service center and asked him, Is it really true, Motorola asked to his customer to pay 80% phone cost to repair mobile phone? But he was not able to answer my questions correctly.  Such kind of unprofessional suggestion and demanding money 80% money without checking problem was not expected out of a authorized service center of Motorola.  How can people will pay Motorola 80% mobile cost to repair faulty phone?  Also, I contacted Flipkart about this problem, however Flipkart Customer care said, ""It's not our problem. Please contact Motorola Service center. We are not responsible after sale service.""  Now I don't know whats is going to happen with my mobile. So I request everyone, Flipkart and Motorola cheating with customers as they are not providing good service after sales. So please don't buy any Moto phone.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,"Moto G (2nd Gen) Hidden Features, Known Issues & Solutions","First of all I would like to confirm that You made a right choice if you have bought this phone.  While decided to buy a new phone i was so confused between the Moto G (2nd Gen) and ASUS ZenFone 5 (16GB).  After doing a lot of research online i found Asus ZenFone 5 Battery is not good when you use 3G Internet or Play Games.  So Here I am not going to share the specification of this phone rather i will focus on some hidden features and known issues and their solutions.  FOR YOUR INFORMATION: 1) This phone support 3g network in only SIM Slot 1. 2) No File Manager installed (You need to download ES File Explorer from Play Store) 3) Simple Stock UI result in Smooth performance. 4) No Lags at all. 5) Guaranteed Android and Security Updates for 18 Months. 6) Battery average (12 Hour Backup with wifi and 3g network on, 1 hour of internet surfing, 30 minutes of gaming, 1 hour of whatsapp, 2 hour of music, some phone calls and 10 minutes of camera use). 7) Fast Startup & ShutDown. 8) Premium Look and Display.  THINGS TO DO AFTER BUYING THIS PHONE? 1) Go to Settings>>About Phone and tap 5 times on Build number to enable developer mode. 2) Go to Settings>>Developer options and Select runtime: Use ART. This will help you save more ram and longer battery life. Doing this will ask you restart the phone.. it may take some times depends on the number of apps you have installed. (You will not lose any of your apps.) 3) Once ART runtime mode is enabled, again navigate to Settings>>Developer options and UNcheck Don't keep activities.. This will help you if you do multitasking. Note: Do not use ART runtime if you restart your phone very frequently as everytime it will take time to optimize apps on the startup. 4) Disable System Apps if you don't use them. For me these includes: Drive, Email, Gmail, Google Korean Keyboard, Google Pinyin Input, Google Play Books, Google Play Games, Google Play Movies, Google Play Newsstand, Google+, Maps, Motorola Alert, Motorola Migrate. Note: You may install K-9 mail as default mail app. i am sure you are gonna love it. Dont forget to disable sync and notifications.  KNOWN ISSUES AND SOLUTIONS 1) This phone lacks an option for WCDMA ONLY mode. To force stay on 3g network, Download ""NETWORK"" by ""PHILIPP MANGELOW"" from play store and select WCDMA ONLY. 2) Notification Bar does not contain quick toggle and it redirects you to the setting menu. To enable quick toggle in notification bar, Download ""NOTIFICATION TOGGLE"" by ""J4VELIN"" from Play Store and customize it according to your needs. There is an option for radio toggles too, so if you install this app then you do not need to install NETWORK from play store. 3) If your music sound goes wired on full volume then use 320 KBPS Original Music files only and / or Go to Settings>>Sound>>Audio Effect and Turn it OFF.  TIPS AND TRICKS 1) Before installing any application, make sure you read all the permission ask by the app developer. 2) Never ever install TrueCaller on your phone because this app sends your contacts to their server and voids the privacy. 3) Always keep Notifications OFF for any app, this will help you save more ram and longer battery backup. You can do it in two ways: (i) Go to particular app>>settings turn all notification off. (ii) Go to Settings>>Apps, select app and UNcheck Show Notifications. 4) Keep your WiFi and Data OFF when you don't need it. 5) Do not install Facebook App and FB Messenger as they will eat more than 110mb of ram.  WHY MOTO G (2ND GEN) AND WHY NOT ASUS ZENFONE 5 (16GB) 1) OPERATING SYSTEM: Moto G Comes with Android 4.4.4 KitKat and is Upgradable to Android 5.0 Lollipop or later for 1.5 years. ASUS ZenFone 5 comes with Android 4.3 JellyBean and is Upgradable to 4.4.2. An update from ASUS confirms that Lollipop will arrive later in June 2015 but no guarantee. 2) PROCESSOR: Moto G Runs on 1.2 GHZ SnapDragon ARM based Processor, On the other hand ASUS runs on 1.6 GHZ Intel x86 based processor. The point here is most of the (99%)android apps are designed to run on an ARM based cpu. 3) RAM: Moto G has 1 GB of RAM and runs on simple stock android and contains no junkware. ASUS has 2GB of ram in which 800 MB is already used by the heavy UI and preinstalled apps that can not be disabled. 4) UI: ASUS wins in the case of User Interface because its ZEN UI is very very beautiful and user friendly. Moto G has Simple stock UI. 5) GPU: Moto is FAR Better in gaming than the Asus as its contains Aderno GPU.  FLIPKART SERVICE Paid Extra 90 Rupees and Get phone after 2 day. POOR SERVICE.  So friends, if you find this review useful then spread this review so that all the users of Moto G can take advantage.",94% of 182 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,Asus zenfone 5 vs Moto g 2nd gen vs Xiomi Redmi 1s,"Writing this review after using all the three phone  I had bought the zenfone 5 just after the launch but after one month of continuous use I realized that it had some fault in the hearing speaker. I checked with my friends zenfone and it was perfectly OK. Flipkart was courteous enough to refund the same. After that I bought moto g new edition. I am not writing the specs comparison which you can get easily at Flipkart and its deceiving sometimes as on paper they may claim heaven but what matters is real performance. I am writing this one for helping the confused buyers considering the user experience and the things which are not compared/ highlighted in online reviews but matters a lot.  Design and build:  Both have the good build quality but I liked the moto g as it feels comfortable to hold. moto g is very soft on hand and for the same screen size its dimensions are less and thus easy to operate. Zenfone has a bigger form factor and the design is edgy so while holding in one hand or while talking its edges hurt. Xiomi Redmi 1s is old school basic design with solid feel but @160g weight its too heavy to carry around.  Display:  Though on paper both have the same specs but the colors are more stunning and vivid on zenfone 5 it feels like an amoled screen. Moto g looks a bit washed out. Xiomi Redmi 1s on paper has the same HD screen but it has a yellowish tinge in the screen and black is not true black as in Moto G so colour contrast is not that impressive.  Processor: All the three have equally powerful processor not much difference.  Multitasking:  Though moto g has the less ram but as it runs vanilla android its requirement is also less so again it's equal in both and I did not find any lag in both.  User experience: zenui wins here as it gives many enhancements over the stock android but after android l upgrade on moto g the situation will completely change. Xiomi Redmi 1s MIUI is like a copy of iOS with lots of improvements but I didnt like personally as it doesnt look modern.  Gaming: I played heavy games like Injustice: Gods among us, Asphalt:8 & Real Racing on both the phones. In this aspect the Zenfone 5 is clear winner as you can play almost all the games in best graphics setting without lag but again be ready keep a charger beside phone as it will eat your battery at approx 10% per 15 min.  If someone is expecting a great gaming experience in Moto g is not for you the above games runs flawlessly on Moto G at medium graphics setting. At high graphics setting the games may close in between due to low RAM but again Battery performance is much better here its 10% per 30 min. Pls dont expect Xiomi Redmi 1s for heavy games it will get so hot that you may not be able to hold it. Camera:  Camera in both the devices are equally good but the default camera app on moto g is pathetic. I installed Google camera app and its great.  Battery: This is the biggest con for zenfone 5. I had to carry my charger all the time. The battery management of Intel processors is still novice. I was traveling on train with GPS on as I was traveling for the first time to this place and the battery ran down from 99% to 30% in just 4.5 hours and still 2 hours journey left. What's the use of such phone which doesn't help in such situations. moto g is satisfactory in this aspect if not great as Qualcomm professors are frugal. Xiomi Redmi 1s is OK in its price range but not great think that it consumes more battery due to heating of the device even on smallest of applications.  Sound: The sound in the Zenfone 5 is really very low and in this aspect the Moto G is way ahead. Moto G is a great media device. Xiomi Redmi 1s s OK in its price range.  The discission completely depends on buyer but for me the battery life is more important compared to any other features so I prefer moto g although a bit pricey.  Note: Xiomi Redmi 1s has improved in the heating department after the latest update from company but it still gets heated up. it took 3 updates from the company with each apprx 30 mb, 300 mb & 512 mb respectively. So make sure you have a broad band to be able to install these updates.",91% of 1022 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,Moto G..best in class..Amazing product,"Hello everyone ....I ordered Moto G on 8th September 2014....it was dispatched with fedex and bad service was a part of my life..from there on......i got the order delivered to me on 15th september that too after i decided to go to fedex outlet in goa and took it from them otherwise it would have been more two days for me...bad service by flipkart.. So after i got my product i first charged it to 100% and kept it for 8hours charging i dont know whether that helps but someone had told me that first time longer charging helps... To tell u the fact the design of the phone is awesome....its confirtable in hand....5"" screen looks big but handy though.....when i first kept for charging i used the samsung charger which i had becoz i had seen reviews abt the moto charger getting heated..but to my suprise the phone started giving some smell i was not sure what was that...but when i changed my charger to moto charger ...the smell jus went.....so if anyone is having isssues of smell from the phone while charging please use moto charger ...the camera is superb good clicks outside...i tried gaming and other apps but the phone has not issues with heating or any other flaws...there are no flaws in this machine.....its born to lead u...and it will.....amazing touch and also display....crisp and bright....the front two speakers look a bit weird but its ok....cz the design of the phone kills it....many people had issues regarding sim card slots...but i found both my slots very much functional and with good network catch...the phone is fast ...smooth...u can call it ""makkhan"".. The Moto migrate is amazing ...it made my migration of contacts from symbian to moto quiet easy .....in just 4-5 steps...the front cam is not bad though....  Now the thing what ur waiting for....and everybody who found it a glitch ..is the battery backup...  i use the phone full day from 9am... i use whatsapp...facebook.....viber...Hike...all on 3G ....a bit of gaming... till 6pm ..m on 3G...after i reach home....i shift to wifi...but my apps are continuously ON.... with so much of usage....i get a backup of minimum 12hrs.....with 20% battery still remaining....so u can get an idea about what u can expect if you are a user like me...  there are no heating issues with the phone which i am happy about....no lags on call neither on camera...  overall awesome phone....... those who are thnking abt buying it..go for it....if u get a faulty piece do replace it and u will get what u want...",91% of 168 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,A good mid-range Android phone.,"Ordered last night just past 12 and received at 2:30 PM today! Fantastic delivery. Couldn't keep up with the tracker's speed :)  Still exploring, will update more later.  Here are the first impressions -   1. Screen: Nice, crisp and vivid, but only 720p. With Snapdragon 400, I guess 720p makes more sense than 1080p. It is 5 inches in size but feels compact and usable in single hand. 2. Performance: Android 4.4.4 comes pre-installed. Lag-free so far. Runs Riptide GP pretty well. Should run all games meant for Snapdragon 400. MS Office, Facebook and Google Drive all work fast and fine.  3. Sound: The front dual speakers are awesome. Very nice sound. None of the other Motos (E/G/X) so far had this kind of fidelity.  4. Camera: 8 MP main cam & 2 MP front. Very good snaps so far both indoors and outdoors. Got only 20 mins to experiment :) 5. Call quality: 2 mics with noise cancellation and a loud speaker! Feels good. 6. Micro SD Slot: This is the greatest inclusion. Moto G sorely missed that. Good option. 7. What else do you want? :) C'mon guys what else do you expect from a phone at this price point? It won't cook your meals or solve your financial problems. Use it practically. It's a good deal. The Moto + Google combination is working out for the masses!  Will get back after a week or so with extended usage report.",88% of 724 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,Bang For Your Buck,"With Xiaomi phones not made available for general public with their show off flash sales, I decided to purchase the Moto G(2nd gen). This handset from the time of launch is still readily available on flipkart :)  I liked the handset look, feel and overall aspects. The Stereo speakers, Camera and additional storage are the biggest upgrades over the previous phones.  The only con in this phone is the very average battery life. If one is a regular user of the phone for browsing, whatsapp, etc several times a day I feel the battery will drain out in about 8-10 hours.   Overall very much satisfied with this phone for a price of Rs 12,999/- and one can buy on demand and not wait for your lucky chance every Tuesday.",96% of 46 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

So Here I am not going to share the specification of this phone rather i will focus on some hidden features and known issues and their solutions.  FOR YOUR INFORMATION: 1) This phone support 3g network in only SIM Slot 1. 2) No File Manager installed (You need to download ES File Explorer from Play Store) 3) Simple Stock UI result in Smooth performance. 4) No Lags at all. 5) Guaranteed Android and Security Updates for 18 Months. 6) Battery average (12 Hour Backup with wifi and 3g network on, 1 hour of internet surfing, 30 minutes of gaming, 1 hour of whatsapp, 2 hour of music, some phone calls and 10 minutes of camera use). 7) Fast Startup & ShutDown. 8) Premium Look and Display.  THINGS TO DO AFTER BUYING THIS PHONE? 1) Go to Settings>>About Phone and tap 5 times on Build number to enable developer mode. 2) Go to Settings>>Developer options and Select runtime: Use ART. This will help you save more ram and longer battery life. Doing this will ask you restart the phone.. it may take some times depends on the number of apps you have installed. (You will not lose any of your apps.) 3) Once ART runtime mode is enabled, again navigate to Settings>>Developer options and UNcheck Don't keep activities.. This will help you if you do multitasking. Note: Do not use ART runtime if you restart your phone very frequently as everytime it will take time to optimize apps on the startup. 4) Disable System Apps if you don't use them. For me these includes: Drive, Email, Gmail, Google Korean Keyboard, Google Pinyin Input, Google Play Books, Google Play Games, Google Play Movies, Google Play Newsstand, Google+, Maps, Motorola Alert, Motorola Migrate. Note: You may install K-9 mail as default mail app. i am sure you are gonna love it. Dont forget to disable sync and notifications.  KNOWN ISSUES AND SOLUTIONS 1) This phone lacks an option for WCDMA ONLY mode. To force stay on 3g network, Download ""NETWORK"" by ""PHILIPP MANGELOW"" from play store and select WCDMA ONLY. 2) Notification Bar does not contain quick toggle and it redirects you to the setting menu. To enable quick toggle in notification bar, Download ""NOTIFICATION TOGGLE"" by ""J4VELIN"" from Play Store and customize it according to your needs. There is an option for radio toggles too, so if you install this app then you do not need to install NETWORK from play store. 3) If your music sound goes wired on full volume then use 320 KBPS Original Music files only and / or Go to Settings>>Sound>>Audio Effect and Turn it OFF.  TIPS AND TRICKS 1) Before installing any application, make sure you read all the permission ask by the app developer. 2) Never ever install TrueCaller on your phone because this app sends your contacts to their server and voids the privacy. 3) Always keep Notifications OFF for any app, this will help you save more ram and longer battery backup. You can do it in two ways: (i) Go to particular app>>settings turn all notification off. (ii) Go to Settings>>Apps, select app and UNcheck Show Notifications. 4) Keep your WiFi and Data OFF when you don't need it. 5) Do not install Facebook App and FB Messenger as they will eat more than 110mb of ram.  WHY MOTO G (2ND GEN) AND WHY NOT ASUS ZENFONE 5 (16GB) 1) OPERATING SYSTEM: Moto G Comes with Android 4.4.4 KitKat and is Upgradable to Android 5.0 Lollipop or later for 1.5 years. ASUS ZenFone 5 comes with Android 4.3 JellyBean and is Upgradable to 4.4.2. An update from ASUS confirms that Lollipop will arrive later in June 2015 but no guarantee. 2) PROCESSOR: Moto G Runs on 1.2 GHZ SnapDragon ARM based Processor, On the other hand ASUS runs on 1.6 GHZ Intel x86 based processor. The point here is most of the (99%)android apps are designed to run on an ARM based cpu. 3) RAM: Moto G has 1 GB of RAM and runs on simple stock android and contains no junkware. ASUS has 2GB of ram in which 800 MB is already used by the heavy UI and preinstalled apps that can not be disabled. 4) UI: ASUS wins in the case of User Interface because its ZEN UI is very very beautiful and user friendly. Moto G has Simple stock UI. 5) GPU: Moto is FAR Better in gaming than the Asus as its contains Aderno GPU.  FLIPKART SERVICE Paid Extra 90 Rupees and Get phone after 2 day. POOR SERVICE.  So friends, if you find this review useful then spread this review so that all the users of Moto G can take advantage.",94% of 182 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,Asus zenfone 5 vs Moto g 2nd gen vs Xiomi Redmi 1s,"Writing this review after using all the three phone  I had bought the zenfone 5 just after the launch but after one month of continuous use I realized that it had some fault in the hearing speaker. I checked with my friends zenfone and it was perfectly OK. Flipkart was courteous enough to refund the same. After that I bought moto g new edition. I am not writing the specs comparison which you can get easily at Flipkart and its deceiving sometimes as on paper they may claim heaven but what matters is real performance. I am writing this one for helping the confused buyers considering the user experience and the things which are not compared/ highlighted in online reviews but matters a lot.  Design and build:  Both have the good build quality but I liked the moto g as it feels comfortable to hold. moto g is very soft on hand and for the same screen size its dimensions are less and thus easy to operate. Zenfone has a bigger form factor and the design is edgy so while holding in one hand or while talking its edges hurt. Xiomi Redmi 1s is old school basic design with solid feel but @160g weight its too heavy to carry around.  Display:  Though on paper both have the same specs but the colors are more stunning and vivid on zenfone 5 it feels like an amoled screen. Moto g looks a bit washed out. Xiomi Redmi 1s on paper has the same HD screen but it has a yellowish tinge in the screen and black is not true black as in Moto G so colour contrast is not that impressive.  Processor: All the three have equally powerful processor not much difference.  Multitasking:  Though moto g has the less ram but as it runs vanilla android its requirement is also less so again it's equal in both and I did not find any lag in both.  User experience: zenui wins here as it gives many enhancements over the stock android but after android l upgrade on moto g the situation will completely change. Xiomi Redmi 1s MIUI is like a copy of iOS with lots of improvements but I didnt like personally as it doesnt look modern.  Gaming: I played heavy games like Injustice: Gods among us, Asphalt:8 & Real Racing on both the phones. In this aspect the Zenfone 5 is clear winner as you can play almost all the games in best graphics setting without lag but again be ready keep a charger beside phone as it will eat your battery at approx 10% per 15 min.  If someone is expecting a great gaming experience in Moto g is not for you the above games runs flawlessly on Moto G at medium graphics setting. At high graphics setting the games may close in between due to low RAM but again Battery performance is much better here its 10% per 30 min. Pls dont expect Xiomi Redmi 1s for heavy games it will get so hot that you may not be able to hold it. Camera:  Camera in both the devices are equally good but the default camera app on moto g is pathetic. I installed Google camera app and its great.  Battery: This is the biggest con for zenfone 5. I had to carry my charger all the time. The battery management of Intel processors is still novice. I was traveling on train with GPS on as I was traveling for the first time to this place and the battery ran down from 99% to 30% in just 4.5 hours and still 2 hours journey left. What's the use of such phone which doesn't help in such situations. moto g is satisfactory in this aspect if not great as Qualcomm professors are frugal. Xiomi Redmi 1s is OK in its price range but not great think that it consumes more battery due to heating of the device even on smallest of applications.  Sound: The sound in the Zenfone 5 is really very low and in this aspect the Moto G is way ahead. Moto G is a great media device. Xiomi Redmi 1s s OK in its price range.  The discission completely depends on buyer but for me the battery life is more important compared to any other features so I prefer moto g although a bit pricey.  Note: Xiomi Redmi 1s has improved in the heating department after the latest update from company but it still gets heated up. it took 3 updates from the company with each apprx 30 mb, 300 mb & 512 mb respectively. So make sure you have a broad band to be able to install these updates.",91% of 1022 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,Moto G..best in class..Amazing product,"Hello everyone ....I ordered Moto G on 8th September 2014....it was dispatched with fedex and bad service was a part of my life..from there on......i got the order delivered to me on 15th september that too after i decided to go to fedex outlet in goa and took it from them otherwise it would have been more two days for me...bad service by flipkart.. So after i got my product i first charged it to 100% and kept it for 8hours charging i dont know whether that helps but someone had told me that first time longer charging helps... To tell u the fact the design of the phone is awesome....its confirtable in hand....5"" screen looks big but handy though.....when i first kept for charging i used the samsung charger which i had becoz i had seen reviews abt the moto charger getting heated..but to my suprise the phone started giving some smell i was not sure what was that...but when i changed my charger to moto charger ...the smell jus went.....so if anyone is having isssues of smell from the phone while charging please use moto charger ...the camera is superb good clicks outside...i tried gaming and other apps but the phone has not issues with heating or any other flaws...there are no flaws in this machine.....its born to lead u...and it will.....amazing touch and also display....crisp and bright....the front two speakers look a bit weird but its ok....cz the design of the phone kills it....many people had issues regarding sim card slots...but i found both my slots very much functional and with good network catch...the phone is fast ...smooth...u can call it ""makkhan"".. The Moto migrate is amazing ...it made my migration of contacts from symbian to moto quiet easy .....in just 4-5 steps...the front cam is not bad though....  Now the thing what ur waiting for....and everybody who found it a glitch ..is the battery backup...  i use the phone full day from 9am... i use whatsapp...facebook.....viber...Hike...all on 3G ....a bit of gaming... till 6pm ..m on 3G...after i reach home....i shift to wifi...but my apps are continuously ON.... with so much of usage....i get a backup of minimum 12hrs.....with 20% battery still remaining....so u can get an idea about what u can expect if you are a user like me...  there are no heating issues with the phone which i am happy about....no lags on call neither on camera...  overall awesome phone....... those who are thnking abt buying it..go for it....if u get a faulty piece do replace it and u will get what u want...",91% of 168 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,A good mid-range Android phone.,"Ordered last night just past 12 and received at 2:30 PM today! Fantastic delivery. Couldn't keep up with the tracker's speed :)  Still exploring, will update more later.  Here are the first impressions -   1. Screen: Nice, crisp and vivid, but only 720p. With Snapdragon 400, I guess 720p makes more sense than 1080p. It is 5 inches in size but feels compact and usable in single hand. 2. Performance: Android 4.4.4 comes pre-installed. Lag-free so far. Runs Riptide GP pretty well. Should run all games meant for Snapdragon 400. MS Office, Facebook and Google Drive all work fast and fine.  3. Sound: The front dual speakers are awesome. Very nice sound. None of the other Motos (E/G/X) so far had this kind of fidelity.  4. Camera: 8 MP main cam & 2 MP front. Very good snaps so far both indoors and outdoors. Got only 20 mins to experiment :) 5. Call quality: 2 mics with noise cancellation and a loud speaker! Feels good. 6. Micro SD Slot: This is the greatest inclusion. Moto G sorely missed that. Good option. 7. What else do you want? :) C'mon guys what else do you expect from a phone at this price point? It won't cook your meals or solve your financial problems. Use it practically. It's a good deal. The Moto + Google combination is working out for the masses!  Will get back after a week or so with extended usage report.",88% of 724 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,Bang For Your Buck,"With Xiaomi phones not made available for general public with their show off flash sales, I decided to purchase the Moto G(2nd gen). This handset from the time of launch is still readily available on flipkart :)  I liked the handset look, feel and overall aspects. The Stereo speakers, Camera and additional storage are the biggest upgrades over the previous phones.  The only con in this phone is the very average battery life. If one is a regular user of the phone for browsing, whatsapp, etc several times a day I feel the battery will drain out in about 8-10 hours.   Overall very much satisfied with this phone for a price of Rs 12,999/- and one can buy on demand and not wait for your lucky chance every Tuesday.",96% of 46 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,1 star,Worst customer service and demanding extra money for repairing from Motorola service center Pune-India,"Hi Everyone,  I am initiating this, to appraise you all of the difficulties, Worst Customer Service, demanding 80% phone cost for repairing and wrong suggestions, I got from PC Support Motorola Service center,Pune and Live Assistance of Motorola India.  Recently I have purchased Motorola 2nd Gen mobile from from flipkart. It was working awesome but unfortunately few drops of the water goes inside the phone from the bottom area and it's switched off. So I visited to Motorola service center Pune to repair my mobile. [PC Support]  However I have faced worst customer service from Motorola and following difficulties I have faced in the service center:  1. They opened back panel of my phone and told me about liquid damage, I agree with them and said please repair my mobile. Then the lady who checked my phone said, ""You have to pay 80% mobile phone cost to repair the phone."". It was totally hilarious and shocking for me because they asked me 80% of money of my phone without checking the problem.  2. After I refused to pay them the lady said please repair your mobile from local mobile shop if they can. [This part was very disappointed to me because how can any authorized service center can tell any customer to go unauthorized local shop to repair your mobile. Is this Motorola company provide service after sell in India?]  3. As my phone is new and I don't want to test or experiment on my phone from any local mobile repair shop, I told her, ""Could you please at least check my phone and provide me details which part in the phone is damage exactly?"" Then she asked me to pay 250 Rs to check my phone and said ""We will call you about problem in 4-5 days."" I said OK and asked them about written detailed report of what you checked and which parts are exactly damaged then she again refused and said, ""Our technical guy will call you that's it."" I was very frustrated and paid them 250 Rs to see what they can tell me about damage of my phone.   4. After experiencing this worst service from Motorola service center, I tried to chat with Motorola online chat assistance. I told him what I have faced problem in the service center and asked him, Is it really true, Motorola asked to his customer to pay 80% phone cost to repair mobile phone? But he was not able to answer my questions correctly.  Such kind of unprofessional suggestion and demanding money 80% money without checking problem was not expected out of a authorized service center of Motorola.  How can people will pay Motorola 80% mobile cost to repair faulty phone?  Also, I contacted Flipkart about this problem, however Flipkart Customer care said, ""It's not our problem. Please contact Motorola Service center. We are not responsible after sale service.""  Now I don't know whats is going to happen with my mobile. So I request everyone, Flipkart and Motorola cheating with customers as they are not providing good service after sales. So please don't buy any Moto phone.

It is more than 12 days now and I still have no confirmation as to when will I get this!!!!! Neither the authorized service center nor Motorola has any definite status, Typical answer is that the case has been escalated and someone will call with in 24 -48 hours to give the update but no one calls.

One fine day, all of sudden, it just gave Motorola logo screen only - There was no falling down or any other external factor, I could attribute this to. First, I tried on line support but it was of no much help. I took this to their authorized service center. I was informed that the mother board has problem and it will need to be replaced and I will get the hand set back in 5-8 days. It is more than 12 days now and I still have no confirmation as to when will I get this!!!!! Neither the authorized service center nor Motorola has any definite status, Typical answer is that the case has been escalated and someone will call with in 24 -48 hours to give the update but no one calls. I strongly suggest that Motorola should have policy of replacing the handset rather than depending on supply of motherboard.",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,Overall Performance - Poor,"I had a very bad experience with Moto-G 2nd Gen. Within less than 5 months, the battery ceased to work and had to take it to the service center. The biggest con is that the battery cannot be removed, it is inbuilt. Very disappointing. :( If the phone gets stuck, when all fails, the last resort is to unplug the battery and the device will restart, that is not possible with this device.  Another big disappointing factor is - the phone has just 1 GB RAM. For a big phone,, 1GB is too less, and hence it lags.   One thing I like about the phone is the Camera - camera is quite good. The lollypop update tried to compensate for the dislike I had, but can't seem to overcome the obvious latency. Overall, I will never buy nor will recommend anyone to buy it. On the contrary,, Moto E is far better.",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

I have been given your contact information regarding the replacement of MotoG2 handset which I bought from Flipkart somewhere around September ( on 24-09-2014, see invoice attached) .  Within 3 months, the phone stopped working and the service center guy told me that motherboard was damaged. After 3 weeks, when my phone started working, the camera stopped working and now again I have to contact the service center and God knows how much time it will take to repair. I tried factory reset, camera updates, and even installed other/Google camera software but even then it is not working.  It seems to me that the hardware of my handset have some serious issues and even if I got my camera fixed, there is no guarantee that some other problem won't be coming in near future.  So, its better if you can replace the set and provide me a new one since this is totally a hardware problem and I want a replacement of my phone.  Hope to get a prompt response from you.  Customer care shared two numbers with me Regional head details: Ashish Patil - ashish.patil@ensureservices.in Contact - 9324395043 Parvez Jawed - parvez.jawed@b2x.com Contact - 8826579279 Ashish's no is always busy and Parvez's no does not exist.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,1 star,Worst After Sale Service,"Motorola has the worst after sale service. I've using this phone for last 3 months with single SIM. When I tried to place the SIM in sim slot2, the slot was not able to detect the SIM. I reached to service center and after examining the phone, they told me that slot is damaged, How could a slot be damaged when actually I never used it. They deposited my phone and told me that it will take 10 days to get repair. It has been 14 days and till now phone is not repaired. When ever I speak to the service center executive, they extend the date by another 10 Days. Called the customer support center and they provide and SR and assured than with 24 hours I'll be getting call back regarding update status. It has been 4 days and I have not received any call regarding my phone. This is very frustrating. So if you are planning to buy this phone, please do kept in mind that their is no after sale support from motorola. Moto is least concern about it's customer.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,3 stars,Worst service by Flipkart & Ekart Logistics!,"I ordered this phone on 4th Feb 2015. It was supposed to be delivered on 7th Jan by 7 pm. Though the status of tracking was shown as ""Out for delivery"" from 12.10 pm itself, I did not receive the product till the end of the day. When I contacted the customer care @ 7.30 pm for this, they just told me to wait and assured that it will be delivered by 9 pm. But it did not happen.  Again when I contacted, they told me that it will be delivered by 8th, though it happens to be a Sunday. Again, @ 11.14 am the status was updated as ""Out for delivery"". I did not receive any single call form the Ekart the whole day. But @ 1.12 pm, it has been updated in their system as ""Undelivered As Customer Requested For Reschedule"".   Without even trying to call the customer, they have updated this status. When I contacted Flipkart stating this issue, they were not even ready to check with Ekart about this. They only told me to wait till 10th Feb. Flipkart simply wants to hold the customers and make them wait by giving false promises.  I have received the product now, but they have not yet responded to complaint that I have raised. I am totally dissatisfied and disappointed with Flipkart's service. Hopeless! They just think they have captured the market and the customers will not leave them even if they provide the worst service. They have mistaken. Just know it Flipkart!

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,3 stars,"Good on Kitkat, poor on Lollipop! Moto G 1st Gen vs 2nd Gen","I own both the 1st and the 2nd Gen. For starters, Moto G 2nd Gen is not at all a worthy upgrade to the 1st and it failed to create the same impact. The camera is good but not much of improvement really. It has two front facing speakers yet the fire at lower volume than the single rear speaker on the 1st Gen. The battery backup is very slightly lesser than the 1st although it is hardly noticeable. Now coming to performance. This phone performed good on Kitkat, although no comparison with the 1st Gen. It lagged a bit while switching between applications. Despite the same hardware, the 1st easily outperforms it and games run much smoother and load faster. After the Lollipop update, the difference in performance has widened even more. 1st Gen performs very well on Lollipop. Resource management is better than even that on Nexus 5. But on the 2nd Gen it has created a number of problems like unnecessary lags even when you switch the WiFi on. Games take even longer to load. Not at all satisfactory. Overall I would say that in this budget, Asus Zenfone 5 is the better than this phone both in terms of performance and camera. If you want to go with Samsung, the Neo 3 is also a good option. Moto G 2nd Gen is disappointing and drops the standard the 1st had raised.",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

From day one there has been audio issues reported by my sister. It took a while for me to physically see the device and confirm that there were audio issues. By then, when I raised a return request, flipkart replied that the stipulated time for return by the seller has crossed. Big fail.  I would rather visit a offline showroom and pick a better device.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,1 star,Worst customer service by Flipkart,"I am certified flipkart buyer since the beginning and have written all positive reviews till today. What makes me write a negative one?  I had ordered a Moto G 2nd generation on 10th feb 2015. This was my 3rd Moto G and this time I was going to gift it to my brother on his birthday. The unit was dispatched by WS retail on time,but today morning when I checked the status of the item..I was shocked to see Cancelled! I called the customer care...they told me I cancelled the item. I tried to convince them that I did not but they didn't listen to me..so I requested to talk to their TL then Mr. Tarun Kumar came online and when I asked him why was my shipment cancelled..then I was shocked again to the reply he gave me..he said it was cancelled by the courier company as you did not receive their call. I told him why wud the courier company call me when the product has not even reached my city and no one actually called...then he flipped his answer and said no sir you cancelled it.This is the customer service of India biggest e-commerce website! Now I was told to order the product again...now when I am trying to order the product..I am shocked again to notice...it says not available with any seller at my pincode! Then how come flipkart delivered the same product 2 weeks back?   Flipkart is losing it and has already lost my trust.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,An amazing phone in an amazing price range,"I have been using this phone from past 5 months. Its an amazing phone and the price range is actually too good to be true. With some negatives like you cannot use wi-fi direct without an external app, little heavy in weight, headphones are not the kind you expect to come with good smartphones and charger does not have a detachable usb cord. But still when you compare all these things with the speed of the phone, battery back-up, overall user interface and amazing features, you forget about the cons of the product. Unlike other smartphones, it never hangs and even when multi-tasking, it responds very very fast.  Overall, I'm simply in love with the phone.  As far as Flipkart is concerned, it's the best online shopping website. Very quick and prompt delivery. I ordered this phone and got the delivery the day after. The products are always packed very nicely. I trust WS Retail and never got any wrong or damaged product ordered from this seller.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,Simply the best,"Got this mobile last September, my first pure android since 2009. A lot better than the samsung junk that is being sold at exorbitant prices and fails to give consumers anything. I've used the device extensively, back when it was Ice cream sandwich, kitkat and now Lollipop. Its come a long way. Its still my favorite mobile. Only glitch is that using in at bangalore with any network, The network here is soo bad, that the battery drains by 10 in the morning. Using it elsewhere or in a single sim, it just lasts and lasts.   One word of advice, if you are using the dual sim functionality, make sure that they are on the same operators. This helps save your battery. With more than one user mode on the device, am now able to configure multiple users, one for home and one for work. And keep both separate.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,Pure Awesomeness,"I ordered this phone on Feb 1st 2015 and got it promptly by the afternoon of Feb 2nd. The packaging and all the other stuff like specs have been spoken about already, so I'll just skip on that. Now, It's been a week since I got the phone up and running for me. From what I've gathered by looking at reviews for this phone before buying it, I must say that I am indeed lucky to get a good piece. As soon as I booted it up and signed in, it showed that the Lollipop update was waiting for me. I quickly upgraded my phone and started using it.  So here's my experience with the phone: -> The interface super smooth and feels awesome to use. -> The battery is awesome even though my phone has WiFi enabled for about 15 hours a day, and also only when I start playing heavy games, the battery starts to drain a bit faster than usual. ->The earphones are okay. I'm not against the Moto earphones, but I'd have liked it with the buds. ->The camera quality is better than what I thought it would be. -> Also some people faced problems wit the lock button and the volume rockers, but i found them compact and firm.  On the whole, holding the phone feels good, and using it feels way too good! :D",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,3 stars,"Moto G Second Generation, Good phone but not the best compared to competition","I wanted to replace my Samsung Galaxy S3 and Iphone with this dual SIM phone. My Samsung GS3 served me well for 2 years but off late had become very laggy and the battery life had become quite bad. I purchased a new 2250 Mah battery from RAW but that did not help much. It seems the phone needed more battery after all the upgrades. I was initially a 32 GB memory card on the phone and recently installed a 64 GB memory card.   My iphone was a 16 GB model and was running out of memory.   The Motorola Second Generation is a well designed easy to hold phone. The first time you start up the phone, the screen looks washed out on google play compared to the Samsung Galaxy S3 but this is not a screen problem. Samsung phones seem to have over-saturated vivid displays which will make most phones look pale. The screen on the Moto G is good and something you will quickly get used to. The pure android OS is also nice. It operates smoothly but is not fast.   The points that I do not like about the phone are  1. Though I purchased the phone for the pure android experience, the pure android experience leaves you feeling short changed. The enhancements made by mobile manufactures, though not the best for performance, are really good for usage and I soon started missing these.  2. AC3 audio is not support on several video files. The same video files worked without issues on the Galaxy. H/W decoding also did not work on several videos. The H/W decode option works for all files on the S3 3. The camera firmware or camera is very poor, text can never be captured correctly. I used both the Iphone and Samsung for OCR from clicked photos. This cannot be done with the Moto G second gen since the text cannot be cleanly captured 4. File transfer rates from the file to a memory card are slower than the Galaxy. I regularly download files and move them to the memory card. While I get 9 MB/s on the 32 GB card in the Galaxy the same card gives me 6 MB/s on the Moto G.  5. For some reason the screen never feels bigger. On all text applications, the amount of text that fits on Galaxy and Moto G is the same. I believe this is because the phones are very close in screen size and the scaling probably happens at a slightly larger screen size.   However the phone also has the following good points.  1. Good battery life, can last through the day 2. Non laggy performance 3. Good WIFI connection 4. Decently fast browser experience.  5. Quick syncing of photos and folders (even if you don't want them synced!!!)  I purchased the Samsung Galaxy S3 almost 3 years ago for 22,400. The moto G second generation, priced at 12,999, doesn't make the S3 look long in the tooth after such a long time, which speaks a lot about the hardware on both phones. The Moto G has average hardware but a great implementation. Except for the AC3 audio everything works fine. The pure android does not give it the polish of a S3 but everything works well when needed.   If you want a great phone for productivity, reminders, OCR, fantastic photos and videos, any iphone will be a seriously good phone. I am not replacing both my phones. If the Samsung Galaxy S3 had a dual SIM option and a better battery life, I would have made that my primary phone. For now I continue to use the iphone and the new Moto G, which is disappointing.   For the price of a Moto G second gen there are lots of good phones available and they have much better camera interfaces, but If you want a slick well built lag free phone that wont go slow on you after many upgrades, I believe the Moto G second gen is good choice.",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,4 stars,"Great phone for the price with a little corner cutting by Motorola, which was expected","Motorola's come back vehicle was Moto X and Moto G (Both 1st Gen)  Moto G was priced Rs13999/-. Great phone and great price.  Moto G 2014 was priced Rs12999/-  This is my personal opinion but I feel that 1.2GHZ seems a little underpowered for a 5inch display.  I dont understand why reduce the price. Keep the same price and offer little something more. Like a bigger battery or a better chipset.  There is no lag in everyday use but sometime when there are a 10 or so windows open in the background, you do notice slight lag in Kitkat.   Lollipop have made the phone more refined. In normal use, you dont find the battery inadequate but use it a little heavily and the battery drain is quite noticeable. One needs to use teh phone keeping in mind that days itinerary!

The gorilla glass is not up to expectations as scratches come to is very easily. Speakers gives a cracking noise at high volumes which is very annoying and unacceptable. And to top it off during the update from kitkat to lollipop the phone just crashed, and i am unable to start it since then. The mobile keeps restarting and nothing is happening, I feel terrible now to have brought this phone as it feels  like a waste of money.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,2 stars,Big Disppointment,"If your planning to buy moto g 2 because of its ""brand"" then please dont! 2 months after I bought my phone it crashed and they told me that my mother board needs to be replaced because apparently ""quite a few Motorola phones are facing this problem"". Its been over 2 weeks since I gave my phone for repair and I haven't got it back yet. The service is terribly slow and disappointing.  The worst part is that I lost all 8 gb of data id stored on my phone so thank god for auto back up that i could recover some of it. Apart from the fact that my phone crashed, its also most inconvenient to use and needs an app for almost everything including one to set a song as ur ringtone and a file explorer among others. The camera lacks basic options like timer and resolution settings. The drop down menu is very tiresome for example it requires u to go to settings then display then auto rotate instead of the usual single click. Also it dosnt come with a connector cable is if u dont have one from an old phone then thats going to be a problem.  Its little things like these that make it very frustrating to use this phone. The best phone for this price is ASUS ZENFONE 5. Its a brilliant phone, amazing processing, useful inbuilt apps, a drop down list u can edit based on ur convenience and an overall a much more satisfactory phone. I've used both phones and buying moto g 2 to replace my Zenfone 5 (when it got stolen :/) was a bad decision on my part and I urge u to not make the same mistake. Im sure you've seen a lot of statistics, but from a user point of use Asus Zenfone 5 is the best choice at this price range and Moto g 2 is a huge disappointment.",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,The Best Phone within Rs. 15000 Budget.. Awesome!!!,"I've used many phones but truly this phone stands at a higher position than the rest. And moreover it will be upgraded to Google's sweetest Lollipop (5.0.2)  Pros-  1. A classy, cool, professional look.  2. Comes with Android Kitkat (4.4.4) But recently have been upgraded to Lollipop (5.0.2)  3. It was fast before, but amazingly fast after the lollipop update.  4. Good storage space (16 GB internal) with expandable storage.  5. It is rain water proof. (Its not a problem if its in your pocket when its raining. But that doesn't mean you should try it out with a bucket full of water. Come on!!! Its not Xperia Z series)  6. I've more than 85 apps installed in my phone (facebook, skype, Chrome, hangout, Line, temple run (1 and 2), subway surfer, compass, Picsart, camscanner, Flipkart, Instagram, Paytm, HDFC, redbus, Truecaller, messenger, whats app, and many more) Even after that it runs amazing fast with only 1 GB RAM.  7. No need to switch it off for changing sims or memory card.  8. Camera quality is awesome in bright light. and in low light it's good.  9. Touch is awesome, though I've matte screen guard, but the smoothness is amazing.  10. Sound is good, as they have made the speakers in front.   11. Can be charged with any USB chargers, unlike Xaomi Redmi, which can't be charged with any charger.  Cons-  1. The charger sometimes get hot (in some particular charging points, not at all charging points) Though the phone doesn't get hot.  2. The LED notification light color is white. It can't be changed to any other color.  3. You can't remove the battery.",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,4 stars,Best in its price class!,"Writing this review after using the the phone for 2-3 days!  Good: Its Moto Awesome screen quality Stock android experience Camera in daylight Nice grip and easy to hold Improved speakers  Bad: Battery backup is not that good as compared to moto g 1st gen Camera in lowlight conditions Speakers give cracking noise at maximum volume  If you are thinking to buy this mid-range smartphone with 13k it would be a great deal according to me, dont matter which phone you used before or this is first smartphone. I liked moto G 2nd gen very much then any other Brands beacuse of its display quality.  I orderd on 29th Jan'15 & got my product delivered on 4th Feb 15. It's awesome but the problem was in the font camera & key section. The front facing cameras picture quality is ok but when i press the capture button its not taking the photo immediately it captures the photo after 5-6 seconds.The second problem is very bad response from the volume rocker buttons.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,MOTO G 2nd Generation its just awesome...,"I bought it 4 months back for my DAD. I am a Samsung enthusiast but same old design of Samsung are coming. You will not understand which model is which???!!!!  Now coming back to Moto G 2nd Gen. After a setback from International market Motorola managed to launch a phone which grabbed a mass market all over the world with Moto E, G & now with Moto G2 & X2.  This phone comes in Mid-Priced mobiles. Its looks are very good & its back cover gives a nice grip too.  Just few days ago Moto rolled out Lollipop update for all mobiles and it good and faster than Kitkat at least I feel the same. It comes with raw OS so you will miss out some important apps like flash light etc. which you can download from Play Store.   I will not go in technical details; but its display, color recreation & video output is really good. Also display comes with Corning Gorilla Glass 3.0.  With 2 front speakers it not a loud phone but speaker volume is good. & in box head phones are waste.. do not use you will feel pain after some time...  Specially camera of Moto G is awesome & it can capture good details in day light but you will observe a little noise in night shots. Its flash is power full.  This phone can handle lot of games like Fifa 14, Real Racing 3, Asphalt 8... Minor heating is observed after some game play.  All in all its a great phone to buy under 15K...

I used the Moto E for 8 months which had a fantastic battery and performance and upgraded to Moto G (2nd Gen) thinking this was a step up, but it isn't. I can't move back to the Moto E because the onboard memory is insufficient for most basic apps.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,4 stars,High performance phone for Lower Price.,"First of all I would like thank Flipkart for their prompt one day delivery. I was looking for a phone wherein i was not ready to spend too much money on the phone since the prices keep fluctuating in the market day by day and at the same time was looking for a exchange of my Samasung Galaxy Y.  Flipkart was kind offering this product with an exchange along with 10% discount on HDFC card which is a cracker.  Now over to the phone:   This is a 5 inch display phone with Gorilla protective glass which is scratch proof resistant. It comes with KitKat OS and i have already upgraded to Lollipop.   The battery backup is not very useful as claimed by the manufacturer unless not continuous browsing, watching videos or playing games. If none of these are used, the battery can be easily managed for 1.5 days.  Its a RAW android and display looks just fine. The camera is crisp and clear though it does not have Image Stabilization, so expect pictures to be blurred or grains under low light.  It does not hang, and sometimes it heats up which is quite normal in any phones for that matter.  The battery is not detachable and will need to be taken to the service center for replacement.   The packing of this material was awesome, thanks to Flipkart.",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,First look and experience - Awesome phone at an affordable price,"So after a much deliberation to get Nexus 5 or Moto G 2nd Gen, I have gone ahead with Moto G(due to budget constraints , lol). Flipkart got the phone to me one day in-advance than the promised date which is like a happy thing for me. The phone looks awesome, looks big and slim shaped, beauty of the Front cam is an asset to the phone. Rear Cam is obviously great not to forget. As soon as I loaded it up, it alarmed me that Lollipop is ready for upgrade. So I used to kitkat version for sometime to explore it was good and immediately upgraded to Lollipop. It was simply awesome. Loved the new look. Coming to the phone, touch is super cool, performance is too good. battery is what I will have to really check as today is the first day. So, I would say this looks like a mini NEXUS 5 for me atleast :) Thanks flipkart for being an awesome ambassador for a great phone in India.",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,Wnna buy a smartphone below 15000 price range...? This is the best option...!!!,"First of all let me introduce myself, I am Venkatesh from Chennai who hasn't owned a smartphone ever before..!!  I actually had to think a lot as there were too many options available for me and I had to choose the best. Meanwhile the Yureka from Micromax's Yu brand played a swirling role in my decision making. There were many, Samsung S3 neo offered by Flipkart for 12500, Redmis's, the Micromaxes, the HTC's, the Nokia's...etc etc...woosh..I had a real wobble and spin into my head..!!! I ordered one, cancelled the next day...!!! Took me nearly a month to zero it to 2 phones...!! It was Yureka or Moto G2 to be chosen..!! Quality or Quantity..? Price or After sales service...? looks or build quality..? Ram or life...?  It all converged into a single point...Why wasting money into a crap which has greater specs but will have no guarantee to last longer..?  I made up my mind to select this one and was not at all disappointed...!!!  I initially received a product one of whose speaker wasn't working...!! i replaced it with a brand new one and runs awesome...!!!  Guess what..? I received the Android 5.0 lollipop update an the same day when I received it..!!!  Battery life is average I would say...will drain out real quick if u are a photo maniac and keep clicking photos all day... :-)  Best suited for the people planning for their first smart phone that should last longer and should be modern and little bit of gaming..!!!  Awesome build quality and beautiful design..!!!  Thumbs up for this phone for it came on my birthday and its my 9th day with my buddy...!!! I love him and im sure that u will too..!!!

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,3 stars,Better to go for other options within same range,"Its great phone for the features it is offering at this price but my recommendation would be any other cell phone except this under same price range.   pros :- M sure u will get hell lot of pros over web search, so skipping it.  cons 1 :- Customer service is not that good and representatives are really irritating sometime. So, for those who wants to buy a phone and stick with it a bit longer time, then my recommendation would be any phone which has good customer care service history. For eg:- Samsung , Nokia, Micromax(Indian company-must encourage it)   cons 2 :- You would be luckiest alive creature to have a moto g/g2 phone with no network problem. It is really really irritating to see ur network playing hide n seek mostly when u will be needing it more. So, if u have a Girlfriend who calls u quite frequently, be prepared to breakup.   Cons 3 :- Dual SIM feature is another myth - It all depends on your fon that wen u will be having single working slot, dual working slot or none of the slot working. Though, switching it off will serve the purpose.   Well, there are lot more but once u r done with all f d above, I don't think I have to give u any more details.   Conclusion :- Take ur time while purchasing one as it is going to stick with u quite for a good time... So, be choosy of ur selection. If some extra bucks will give u satisfaction, then its worth spending on. Good Luck! Happy Buying... (Y)",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,Peace of mind!!! Just buy it!!! Bang for the buck,"I ordered the phone from flipkart and got it in mint condition. The packaging was very good. I also bought a motoshell flip cover which was equally prime in quality. Now coming to the review. The phone looks just brilliant and has smooth curved edges. It has got a non-removable battery, but that is not an issue for me. We hardly replace batteries for our smartphones, we just buy a new one!!! It ran on android kitkat but later I got the lollipop update and I am using that now. I have used the phone for a month now. No crashes and misbehaving UI for me as I have seen in certain forums about Moto G. The charger is just a beauty. It is sleek and white in colour and always does its job. It gets a bit hot while charging but it is not like it will melt and go out of order. I am using the phone without any clumsy screen guard (I have the motoshell for that :-)) and till now the screen is jet black and without any scratches. The HD display is mind boggling and it is such a joy to watch anything on the screen, whether it is playing videos or games or just reading books and stuff like that. I am in love with the digital vibrance of the display. Its too cool. Now coming to performance. Normally out of 1GB of ram 460 - 480 MB will always be free. While running some heavy weight games such as Asphalt 8 or Dead Trigger it will come down to some 320MB or so. So according to me it is quite efficient with its RAM usage. It is a joy to play games on it with it Adreno subsystem. There is not noticeable lag on the UI while entering or exiting heavy applications. Battery life (its a bit early to comment) could have been better but that is not a downside as per me. The stock headphones are not that good and does not produce good thump or bass. I would like Motorola to work on that in future iterations. There are no heating issues while playing games. I have played games for couple of hours straight, and the only heat I get is where I hold it, that is my own body heat transferred to the set. The stock android runs great and I dont like to disturb the ecosystem by installing rubbish apps. The apps bundled are enough for most of our needs except gaming which we need to download. Ofcourse there is no File manager software, which is a downside slightly to this awesome product but you can use freely available ES Explorer or Solid Explorer for this purpose, not a big deal. The speakers are awesome and generates stereo quality sound. I am not deterring you from buying Micromax Yu or Redmi mobiles, but there have there fair share of problems albeit the low price, but Motorola has got it perfect this time with Moto G. I would like them to add 4G LTE to future models though. Hope you find this review helpful. Thanks and do but it without second thoughts. You wont regret it :-) :-) :-)",0 of 1 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,"Moto G (2nd Gen) Hidden Features, Known Issues & Solutions","First of all I would like to confirm that You made a right choice if you have bought this phone.  While decided to buy a new phone i was so confused between the Moto G (2nd Gen) and ASUS ZenFone 5 (16GB).  After doing a lot of research online i found Asus ZenFone 5 Battery is not good when you use 3G Internet or Play Games.  So Here I am not going to share the specification of this phone rather i will focus on some hidden features and known issues and their solutions.  FOR YOUR INFORMATION: 1) This phone support 3g network in only SIM Slot 1. 2) No File Manager installed (You need to download ES File Explorer from Play Store) 3) Simple Stock UI result in Smooth performance. 4) No Lags at all. 5) Guaranteed Android and Security Updates for 18 Months. 6) Battery average (12 Hour Backup with wifi and 3g network on, 1 hour of internet surfing, 30 minutes of gaming, 1 hour of whatsapp, 2 hour of music, some phone calls and 10 minutes of camera use). 7) Fast Startup & ShutDown. 8) Premium Look and Display.  THINGS TO DO AFTER BUYING THIS PHONE? 1) Go to Settings>>About Phone and tap 5 times on Build number to enable developer mode. 2) Go to Settings>>Developer options and Select runtime: Use ART. This will help you save more ram and longer battery life. Doing this will ask you restart the phone.. it may take some times depends on the number of apps you have installed. (You will not lose any of your apps.) 3) Once ART runtime mode is enabled, again navigate to Settings>>Developer options and UNcheck Don't keep activities.. This will help you if you do multitasking. Note: Do not use ART runtime if you restart your phone very frequently as everytime it will take time to optimize apps on the startup. 4) Disable System Apps if you don't use them. For me these includes: Drive, Email, Gmail, Google Korean Keyboard, Google Pinyin Input, Google Play Books, Google Play Games, Google Play Movies, Google Play Newsstand, Google+, Maps, Motorola Alert, Motorola Migrate. Note: You may install K-9 mail as default mail app. i am sure you are gonna love it. Dont forget to disable sync and notifications.  KNOWN ISSUES AND SOLUTIONS 1) This phone lacks an option for WCDMA ONLY mode. To force stay on 3g network, Download ""NETWORK"" by ""PHILIPP MANGELOW"" from play store and select WCDMA ONLY. 2) Notification Bar does not contain quick toggle and it redirects you to the setting menu. To enable quick toggle in notification bar, Download ""NOTIFICATION TOGGLE"" by ""J4VELIN"" from Play Store and customize it according to your needs. There is an option for radio toggles too, so if you install this app then you do not need to install NETWORK from play store. 3) If your music sound goes wired on full volume then use 320 KBPS Original Music files only and / or Go to Settings>>Sound>>Audio Effect and Turn it OFF.  TIPS AND TRICKS 1) Before installing any application, make sure you read all the permission ask by the app developer. 2) Never ever install TrueCaller on your phone because this app sends your contacts to their server and voids the privacy. 3) Always keep Notifications OFF for any app, this will help you save more ram and longer battery backup. You can do it in two ways: (i) Go to particular app>>settings turn all notification off. (ii) Go to Settings>>Apps, select app and UNcheck Show Notifications. 4) Keep your WiFi and Data OFF when you don't need it. 5) Do not install Facebook App and FB Messenger as they will eat more than 110mb of ram.  WHY MOTO G (2ND GEN) AND WHY NOT ASUS ZENFONE 5 (16GB) 1) OPERATING SYSTEM: Moto G Comes with Android 4.4.4 KitKat and is Upgradable to Android 5.0 Lollipop or later for 1.5 years. ASUS ZenFone 5 comes with Android 4.3 JellyBean and is Upgradable to 4.4.2. An update from ASUS confirms that Lollipop will arrive later in June 2015 but no guarantee. 2) PROCESSOR: Moto G Runs on 1.2 GHZ SnapDragon ARM based Processor, On the other hand ASUS runs on 1.6 GHZ Intel x86 based processor. The point here is most of the (99%)android apps are designed to run on an ARM based cpu. 3) RAM: Moto G has 1 GB of RAM and runs on simple stock android and contains no junkware. ASUS has 2GB of ram in which 800 MB is already used by the heavy UI and preinstalled apps that can not be disabled. 4) UI: ASUS wins in the case of User Interface because its ZEN UI is very very beautiful and user friendly. Moto G has Simple stock UI. 5) GPU: Moto is FAR Better in gaming than the Asus as its contains Aderno GPU.  FLIPKART SERVICE Paid Extra 90 Rupees and Get phone after 2 day. POOR SERVICE.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,Asus zenfone 5 vs Moto g 2nd gen vs Xiomi Redmi 1s,"Writing this review after using all the three phone  I had bought the zenfone 5 just after the launch but after one month of continuous use I realized that it had some fault in the hearing speaker. I checked with my friends zenfone and it was perfectly OK. Flipkart was courteous enough to refund the same. After that I bought moto g new edition. I am not writing the specs comparison which you can get easily at Flipkart and its deceiving sometimes as on paper they may claim heaven but what matters is real performance. I am writing this one for helping the confused buyers considering the user experience and the things which are not compared/ highlighted in online reviews but matters a lot.  Design and build:  Both have the good build quality but I liked the moto g as it feels comfortable to hold. moto g is very soft on hand and for the same screen size its dimensions are less and thus easy to operate. Zenfone has a bigger form factor and the design is edgy so while holding in one hand or while talking its edges hurt. Xiomi Redmi 1s is old school basic design with solid feel but @160g weight its too heavy to carry around.  Display:  Though on paper both have the same specs but the colors are more stunning and vivid on zenfone 5 it feels like an amoled screen. Moto g looks a bit washed out. Xiomi Redmi 1s on paper has the same HD screen but it has a yellowish tinge in the screen and black is not true black as in Moto G so colour contrast is not that impressive.  Processor: All the three have equally powerful processor not much difference.  Multitasking:  Though moto g has the less ram but as it runs vanilla android its requirement is also less so again it's equal in both and I did not find any lag in both.  User experience: zenui wins here as it gives many enhancements over the stock android but after android l upgrade on moto g the situation will completely change. Xiomi Redmi 1s MIUI is like a copy of iOS with lots of improvements but I didnt like personally as it doesnt look modern.  Gaming: I played heavy games like Injustice: Gods among us, Asphalt:8 & Real Racing on both the phones. In this aspect the Zenfone 5 is clear winner as you can play almost all the games in best graphics setting without lag but again be ready keep a charger beside phone as it will eat your battery at approx 10% per 15 min.  If someone is expecting a great gaming experience in Moto g is not for you the above games runs flawlessly on Moto G at medium graphics setting. At high graphics setting the games may close in between due to low RAM but again Battery performance is much better here its 10% per 30 min. Pls dont expect Xiomi Redmi 1s for heavy games it will get so hot that you may not be able to hold it. Camera:  Camera in both the devices are equally good but the default camera app on moto g is pathetic. I installed Google camera app and its great.  Battery: This is the biggest con for zenfone 5. I had to carry my charger all the time. The battery management of Intel processors is still novice. I was traveling on train with GPS on as I was traveling for the first time to this place and the battery ran down from 99% to 30% in just 4.5 hours and still 2 hours journey left. What's the use of such phone which doesn't help in such situations. moto g is satisfactory in this aspect if not great as Qualcomm professors are frugal. Xiomi Redmi 1s is OK in its price range but not great think that it consumes more battery due to heating of the device even on smallest of applications.  Sound: The sound in the Zenfone 5 is really very low and in this aspect the Moto G is way ahead. Moto G is a great media device. Xiomi Redmi 1s s OK in its price range.  The discission completely depends on buyer but for me the battery life is more important compared to any other features so I prefer moto g although a bit pricey.  Note: Xiomi Redmi 1s has improved in the heating department after the latest update from company but it still gets heated up. it took 3 updates from the company with each apprx 30 mb, 300 mb & 512 mb respectively. So make sure you have a broad band to be able to install these updates.",91% of 1022 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase
Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,Moto G..best in class..Amazing product,"Hello everyone ....I ordered Moto G on 8th September 2014....it was dispatched with fedex and bad service was a part of my life..from there on......i got the order delivered to me on 15th september that too after i decided to go to fedex outlet in goa and took it from them otherwise it would have been more two days for me...bad service by flipkart.. So after i got my product i first charged it to 100% and kept it for 8hours charging i dont know whether that helps but someone had told me that first time longer charging helps... To tell u the fact the design of the phone is awesome....its confirtable in hand....5"" screen looks big but handy though.....when i first kept for charging i used the samsung charger which i had becoz i had seen reviews abt the moto charger getting heated..but to my suprise the phone started giving some smell i was not sure what was that...but when i changed my charger to moto charger ...the smell jus went.....so if anyone is having isssues of smell from the phone while charging please use moto charger ...the camera is superb good clicks outside...i tried gaming and other apps but the phone has not issues with heating or any other flaws...there are no flaws in this machine.....its born to lead u...and it will.....amazing touch and also display....crisp and bright....the front two speakers look a bit weird but its ok....cz the design of the phone kills it....many people had issues regarding sim card slots...but i found both my slots very much functional and with good network catch...the phone is fast ...smooth...u can call it ""makkhan"".. The Moto migrate is amazing ...it made my migration of contacts from symbian to moto quiet easy .....in just 4-5 steps...the front cam is not bad though....  Now the thing what ur waiting for....and everybody who found it a glitch ..is the battery backup...  i use the phone full day from 9am... i use whatsapp...facebook.....viber...Hike...all on 3G ....a bit of gaming... till 6pm ..m on 3G...after i reach home....i shift to wifi...but my apps are continuously ON.... with so much of usage....i get a backup of minimum 12hrs.....with 20% battery still remaining....so u can get an idea about what u can expect if you are a user like me...  there are no heating issues with the phone which i am happy about....no lags on call neither on camera...  overall awesome phone....... those who are thnking abt buying it..go for it....if u get a faulty piece do replace it and u will get what u want...",91% of 168 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,A good mid-range Android phone.,"Ordered last night just past 12 and received at 2:30 PM today! Fantastic delivery. Couldn't keep up with the tracker's speed :)  Still exploring, will update more later.  Here are the first impressions -   1. Screen: Nice, crisp and vivid, but only 720p. With Snapdragon 400, I guess 720p makes more sense than 1080p. It is 5 inches in size but feels compact and usable in single hand. 2. Performance: Android 4.4.4 comes pre-installed. Lag-free so far. Runs Riptide GP pretty well. Should run all games meant for Snapdragon 400. MS Office, Facebook and Google Drive all work fast and fine.  3. Sound: The front dual speakers are awesome. Very nice sound. None of the other Motos (E/G/X) so far had this kind of fidelity.  4. Camera: 8 MP main cam & 2 MP front. Very good snaps so far both indoors and outdoors. Got only 20 mins to experiment :) 5. Call quality: 2 mics with noise cancellation and a loud speaker! Feels good. 6. Micro SD Slot: This is the greatest inclusion. Moto G sorely missed that. Good option. 7. What else do you want? :) C'mon guys what else do you expect from a phone at this price point? It won't cook your meals or solve your financial problems. Use it practically. It's a good deal. The Moto + Google combination is working out for the masses!

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,Bang For Your Buck,"With Xiaomi phones not made available for general public with their show off flash sales, I decided to purchase the Moto G(2nd gen). This handset from the time of launch is still readily available on flipkart :)  I liked the handset look, feel and overall aspects. The Stereo speakers, Camera and additional storage are the biggest upgrades over the previous phones.  The only con in this phone is the very average battery life. If one is a regular user of the phone for browsing, whatsapp, etc several times a day I feel the battery will drain out in about 8-10 hours.   Overall very much satisfied with this phone for a price of Rs 12,999/- and one can buy on demand and not wait for your lucky chance every Tuesday.",96% of 46 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,1 star,Worst customer service and demanding extra money for repairing from Motorola service center Pune-India,"Hi Everyone,  I am initiating this, to appraise you all of the difficulties, Worst Customer Service, demanding 80% phone cost for repairing and wrong suggestions, I got from PC Support Motorola Service center,Pune and Live Assistance of Motorola India.  Recently I have purchased Motorola 2nd Gen mobile from from flipkart. It was working awesome but unfortunately few drops of the water goes inside the phone from the bottom area and it's switched off. So I visited to Motorola service center Pune to repair my mobile. [PC Support]  However I have faced worst customer service from Motorola and following difficulties I have faced in the service center:  1. They opened back panel of my phone and told me about liquid damage, I agree with them and said please repair my mobile. Then the lady who checked my phone said, ""You have to pay 80% mobile phone cost to repair the phone."". It was totally hilarious and shocking for me because they asked me 80% of money of my phone without checking the problem.  2. After I refused to pay them the lady said please repair your mobile from local mobile shop if they can. [This part was very disappointed to me because how can any authorized service center can tell any customer to go unauthorized local shop to repair your mobile. Is this Motorola company provide service after sell in India?]  3. As my phone is new and I don't want to test or experiment on my phone from any local mobile repair shop, I told her, ""Could you please at least check my phone and provide me details which part in the phone is damage exactly?"" Then she asked me to pay 250 Rs to check my phone and said ""We will call you about problem in 4-5 days."" I said OK and asked them about written detailed report of what you checked and which parts are exactly damaged then she again refused and said, ""Our technical guy will call you that's it."" I was very frustrated and paid them 250 Rs to see what they can tell me about damage of my phone.   4. After experiencing this worst service from Motorola service center, I tried to chat with Motorola online chat assistance. I told him what I have faced problem in the service center and asked him, Is it really true, Motorola asked to his customer to pay 80% phone cost to repair mobile phone? But he was not able to answer my questions correctly.  Such kind of unprofessional suggestion and demanding money 80% money without checking problem was not expected out of a authorized service center of Motorola.  How can people will pay Motorola 80% mobile cost to repair faulty phone?  Also, I contacted Flipkart about this problem, however Flipkart Customer care said, ""It's not our problem. Please contact Motorola Service center. We are not responsible after sale service.""  Now I don't know whats is going to happen with my mobile. So I request everyone, Flipkart and Motorola cheating with customers as they are not providing good service after sales. So please don't buy any Moto phone.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,1 star,Poor after sales service by Motorola,"I am resident of Amritsar Punjab. My wife who uses this phone commutes daily to Medical College, Jalandhar. I purchased Moto g2 in Oct 2014. Recently I received Notification for Lollipop update. When I started download on the night of 29 Jan 2015, it got stuck at 15%. I waited for 45 min. But it didn't increased. Finding no other option I restarted the phone. On restarting the download automatically resumed from 15%. On completion of download it asked to install. I clicked yes. Then it showed shutting down dialogue and then the screen after restart showed Motorola logo with powered by android written below. That was it and thereafter it got stuck there. I waited for 01 hour but nothing happened. I thought the process of installation is going to take long. So I put the phone on charging as the screen was on and then I slept. In the morning I found same thing on screen i.e. Motorola logo with powered by android written below. The phone couldn't be switched off. I had to go to Medical College Jalandhar with my wife. So I decided to go to Motorola service center at 2nd floor, Monica Tower, Milap Chowk Jalandhar. But they told me to go to New Rays Enterprises, SCO 11, Khukhrana Complex, Canal Road, near Khaira Palace, Main Road, Jalandhar as that is the authorized service station for Moto g2 bought from Flipkart. I went there. That center was just awful. There was a single person who seemed clueless about what he was doing. The aluminium partition was shut from inside. You have to give the phone and communicate with that person through a window. I told him the whole story. He removed sim and memory card and disassembled the phone. I was surprised as I was thinking throughout that it was a software problem. Then he took the phone to a well covered corner in the room where I couldn't see what was he doing. He took 10 minutes for inspecting the phone. Then he said that it was a motherboard problem and I would have to leave the phone there. I said I can't leave the phone as I have to go back to Amritsar in about an hour. He then reassembled the phone and when he put back the sim he said the lock was broken. When I asked how he blamed it on me. I was furious. When I checked myself the lock was intact. I wondered that the guy, who can't tell whether sim lock is ok or not, is quoting problem with the motherboard of the phone. When I went to Medical College, Jalandhar I showed the phone to software engineer of the IT department of the Medical College. He told the problem was that the new version didn't install and old version got removed. He is confident that he will be able to install the software properly. I became depressed with the pathetic after sales service of Motorola. No doubt The device is flawless but the service centers are just pathetic. I even came to know that they remove the original LCD panels of the phone and replace them with the fake ones. All this has been a rude shock to me. I was a fan of Motorola device but now I have to really think hard whether to buy Motorola phone in future or not.",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,4 stars,Very good phone but..,I'll directly come to pros and cons of this very good phone.. Pros -  * Value for money * Not much of heating issue unlike most of the android phones * smooth interface * Upgradeable to Lollypop * Almost native android * dual sim and good speakers * decent camera * Feels sturdy Cons - * Pathetic display. You can't take pic or make call in sunlight(You won't be able to see anything in bright sunlight) * Just 1 GB RAM * No support for 4G  Overall it's a good phone but not exceptional. If Lenovo can upgrade the display it will be awesome camera.  5 stars to flipkart for delivering within 48 hrs.,0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,4 stars,Perfect in this range,"This is my first smartphone ordered on the very first day of G2 release. Also as promised by Motorola, got update of Android L.  Pros:  1) G2 has really very stylish look(gorilla touch :)) as compared to other mobile of same range. Also 5 inch screen fits perfectly in my hand. 2) Front camera takes really nice selfies 3) Sound quality is good with dual speakers in it.(but dont expect sound like beats audio :P) 4) With extended memory card slot, it complets your memory requirement. 5) Also, Android L makes MOTO G2 perfect mobile in this range. Rest all the features mentioned are as mentioned, so I don't want to explicitly mention it.  Cons: 1) I am quite not satisfied with rear camera (8MP though). 2) Battery drainer. Needs more Power battery since 5 inch screen + android(battery drainer) 3) ONE MAJOR ISSUE, I noted serveral times is that whenever my battery gets fully discharged and then when I plugged my charger to charge and kept it for few minutes(10 mins). After that, I tried to turn on cell by removing charger, but it didn't start for 20-30 mins and was continously showing battery % in charging state(though charger is removed) whenever I clicked the power button. It was quite annoying. Later it automatically got started after 20-30 odd minutes.",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase
Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,"Working good with Lollypop, satisfied !","Experience-  I purchased two units, first in 13K for my father in October during launch. Based on his positive feedback I risked for me.  Bought Second under old phone exchange program, Where I returned my previous phone Sony Ericsson WT19i at 3K + 1K off on HDFC card. And got this one for 9K, nice deal, ah !  But even if I had bought it for 13K, its worth !   Upgradation to lollypop - Was in doubt whether to update OS but eventually it was worth. There is no lagging wrt performance, UI is refreshed. I don't see anything wrong in updating.   - Only issue with the phone is, it's now pretty common in the segment, but if that doesn't bother you..

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,Good phone & Amazing Flipkart service,"I ordered the phone for my father who was using the smart phone for the first time. When it got delivered it had lots of dead pixels & he did not know that it was a feature rather than a defect.  When I found out few days later, I called flipkart and they were brilliant in sending me a replacement. The replacement is brilliant - so a big thank you to the Flipkart service.  Now coming to the phone itself - be careful what you wish for. It is a 13K phone and comes with features which is apt for that price and no wonder it has 4 ratings with over 18K reviews.  I use Grand 2 so I am comparing against that.  1. Display brilliant, but don't compare it against Galaxy Grand 2, which'd cost another 3 K more. 2. CPU - very comparable. 3. RAM - 1GB vs 1.5 in Grand 2.  So, if you are looking to install lots of games that use too much RAM, think twice. If you are more whatsapp/facebook/phone call type person, then this may be the phone for you.",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,"BEST PHONE I,VE EVER USED","I change phones in every 8-9 months max. I,ve used sony phones, I love HTC phones but this phone is awesome as promised it is now updated to lollipop and even with such a low price I did not compromise in almost anything. it's incredibly fast and combined with the lollipop it's even better. it's very fast and almost lag free even with usage that is heavier than daily usage. the battery life is not great but ok. the lollipop's battery saver works splendid increasing the battery life greatly but it turns off the background data for every thing that means no mails no whatsapp messages. in general this phone is awesome and handles even heavy games with ease.",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,1 star,VERY POOR SERVICE,"Never BUY Motorola products. I buy Moto g 2nd Gen in end of August and I was very happy with my phone, but after 2 months in Dec my camera stopped working I thought it was due to some camera and Google NOW updates last night so I removed all updates and try to reboot my mobile but nothing helped. I called Flipkart and they suggested me to approach the nearest Motorola service center. Service center told me that I have to hand over the handset for the review. As I buy this set with exchange offer I haven't any handset as an alternative mobile. So I postponed it till I arranged an alternative mobile for calls. I reached service center on 7th Jan and after a day review they told me that it is a hardware problem and the camera needs to be replaced. It took 10 days to be repaired and when I get back my mobile I discovered that it was loosely fitted and if I properly fit the cover its on/off button stops working. It was Saturday evening when I get it back so I had to wait till Monday when the service center reopens. As my phone was factory reset when I received it back, I try to setup my ringtone of my choice but I found that the speaker sound was too low I try to increase the volume but noticed that it is already showing highest! Crap!! It has now volume issue!! On Monday morning tried to call service center and guess what my mobile touch stopped working. It was freeze and I was not able to do anything now!! Even unable to reboot it as I need to touch the screen in order to do it. I was frosted I thought I was just due to the fact it was loosely fitted but next day Service center told me that it's motherboard need to be replaced. I called Motorola customer care to replace my mobile but it is about 10 days I did not receive any prompt response. I call the customer care almost daily, but every day I get the same feedback that the technical team is looking at the issue and I will get a feedback call from their side but I didn't get any feedback from their side. I must say they have very POOR service.",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,4 stars,High cost of repair,I got this mobile two months back .. and was enjoying the same...

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,Awesome,"This phone is really awesome for the price.   Pros:   Good processor Little lag( Hardly any lag when i updated to Android L) Very sturdy- This phone is very sturdy. I have accidentally dropped my phone at least 10 times till now. No crack on screen or anything. Very sturdy as compared to other good phones like asus zenfone 5. Water proof- This doesnt mean that you use it while in the pool. it can easily bear some water on the surface. Expandable storage upto 32 gb. Along with my 16 gb internal i have external 32 gb. memory isint a problem. Updates(Moto g is one of the 1st phones to recieve Android L)  Cons:  RAM- only 1 gb hence multi tasking is a problem, u can play heavy games on medium settings. Camera- i did not like the camera app of moto g2. very average interface. Battery life- same as the moto g1. The screen of moto g2 is bigger than it's previous version hence battery is consumed more. This phone should have had more battery life. Speakers- The voice somewhat cracks at high volume(smooth voice after upgrading to Android L. I dont know how)  As compared to other phones, this phone is very good(Asus zenfone 5 has stronger processor and 2 gb ram, better display but it is fragile, not specified as waterproof, voice quality while calling is not as good as moto g2, display not as bright as that of moto g2) In short, Moto G2 is an all rounder for the price.

A very decent and preferable device i have ever seen.. OTG support, full hd video, and it supports all the functions as mentioned in the 'about' part..  Only cons i can talk about are: ~ First, the battery. It should be of more power. its drainage is very fast. It drains like a flowing water while transferring files using OTG. On heavy usage, using internet, battery can lasts upto 7-8 hours. ~Secondly, The display is not very pretty as compared to the old Moto G. Its colors is not as much bright as moto g. but supports full hd videos without any lag. ~Third, Motorola Headphones are of very bad quality. Even in full volume it sound very slow and not be considered as a good quality earphones. Samsung or other are very good as compared to motorola..

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,1 star,Awful experience,"I was looking forward to this phone as my birthday present to myself. I was utterly disappointed with the model as the basic audio of the phone had an irritating disturbance. I experienced this disturbance each time I attended or called someone. I wanted to get the phone replaced but the customer service agents would just not do it as easily. I was asked to follow a troubleshooting exercise which did not resolve the problem, even so my ticket was closed as- the customer declined the request to replace the device. In my third attempt I was lucky enough to get it replaced. Finally, I was eagerly awaiting the new handset as I thought only my earlier piece had this audio disturbance issue. As soon as I inserted the sim to check the audio , I faced the same issue of audio disturbance It is to my utmost dissatisfaction that I am writing this review as my experience could not have been worse. If it is a company defect then it needs to be highlighted immediately and I believe products when going for replacement should be checked once to be sure that atleast the next time the customer is not left dissatisfied.",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,4 stars,JUST GO FOR IT!,"I checked on alcatel one touch, huwaei honor6, micromax YU (exclusive on amazon), lenovo vibe x2 before deciding to go for moto g 2nd gen & I think it was a wise decision.   I exchanged my BB Z10 for this moto g 2nd gen. I also applied the hdfc offer and ended up getting this moto g 2nd gen for about 8k. It will not be fair to compare this phone with the Z10 as that will make the Moto look terrible (os 10 is about 5 yrs ahead of android). I needed a dual sim badly as I was not able to manage 2 different phones and I had a moderate budget.   The 1st thing i did after switching on the phone was to upgrade it to Version 5.0 Lollypop. I had used Kitkat before and found it pretty average both in terms of look, features and functionality. I think Lollypop is a much better os version than previous ones. It also brings across a refreshing new UI and virtual buttons. User experience on Android V.5 Lollypop is awesome.  The look and finish of the phone is nice. The back panel is made of rubbarised plastic which makes for a comfortable grip and does not show fingerprints. Overall, it gives the look of an expensive phone. Gorilla Glass 3 makes it strong/sturdy & gives it a premium look. No need putting screen protector if you got gorilla glass 3.   I have about 15 basic apps (fb, linkedin, twitter, tripadvisor,cleartrip, olx, watsapp etc) downloaded on the phone. All apps work seamless with the 1 GB RAM and 1.2 Ghz Quadcore processor. However, there is a slight lag from the time you hit the green call button on the dial pad to the time the number actually starts dialing. But its just about a second so does not make a big difference.  Camera quality (both front and rear) is very good (they have multiple modes and settings for different outputs). Camera is good under low lighting as well. Overall, its ahead of my expectations from it.  Before I bought this phone I had read reviews of many flipkart buyers who were disappointed with the battery life of this phone. Even my Z10 had the same capacity battery but moto g definitely lasts longer. My phone is connected to wifi the whole day & all location based services are turned on. At a full charge, this phone gives me about 3 hrs of voice calls, 2 hours of you tube and 1 hour of gaming before I need to put it on charging again. Realistically i think it is good battery performance and 2070 mAh battery is a decent deal at this price.  Overall, a good phone to have. would have given it a 5 star if it had an extra GB of RAM.",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,4 stars,VERY GOOD but some minor features missing,"In my opinion this phone is the BEST in its price range. It handles apps very smoothly and without any lags. But some minor features are missing such as, voice recorder, self timer camera and it doesn't have other video recording size option, only 720p. But this can be obtained by installing some apps, so not much of a problem. It doesn't support mkv avi mov and some more video formats. But MX Player supports all video formats, hence this also isn't much of a trouble. The panorama is one thing i found very poor about this phone, but still its ease of focusing, lighting and image and video quality makes us forget that. Overall i would recommend it to all who are searching for a good quality phone in this price range.",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

When I started using the phone it just happen to check the internal storage capacity of the phone. To my surprise the storage capacity was only 12.90 GB & not 16 GB.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,3 stars,Not upto mark,"I became customer of Motorola with it's Moto G series. I was so happy with it that I got whole my family either a Moto G1 or Moto E. And when Moto G2 was launched, I was happy to realize that I can now have a larger moto G with much better specs at optimal cost. But alas, Moto G2 has disappointed me. With larger display comes the proportionally larger fonts and icons, which means, it'll seem like you've watching at a zoomed in phone. I needed a larger display to space more items on screen. However, it just got them bigger in size. Apart from this nonsensical issue, the major two issues I'm facing are: 1. Quick battery draining, as the 5"" display requires larger capacity battery which Moto G2 certainly hasn't, and 2. Overheating. I don't know what's wrong with this series but Moto G2 has a serious over heating problem during charging as well as during working on it. So, now that many alternate options are available in market, I won't suggest anyone to buy Moto G2",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,Moto X 2014 is absolutely amazing.,"I have been using this phone since 4 months. Works butter smooth! No lag of force closes yet. Switching between apps if lightning fast. Every high-end game played ran smoothly mostly giving 40 FPS.  Pure Android feels great. Display is just awesome and proves to be the best source of entertainment(Games and youtube mostly :P) in boring lectures.   The voice commands and Moto Assist are just amazing.  Friends usually end up playing allot on X. And when they start to annoy you, just shout out ""Wake up Falix"" and Moto would listen even in a noisy environment.  Ambient|Active display is very helpful. I never use the power button to unlock the phone, it just knows when you are around or wanna play with it and wakes up immediately.   Well thats all the good stuff. Coming to the bad ones I would like to exclusively mention the batter. The battery lasts for a complete day on normal usage around an hour of gaming etc..  If you forget to plug in your phone at night, it'll be useless the next day. I would be happy if Moto could have squeezed in a larger battery.  A friend bought an iPhone 6 recently. I was playing around with its camera and that was the first time i realised how bad was X's camera in ""low light"". I'm not a professional photographer but i still expect Moto to work on the camera.   Rest all about the Moto X is green. If you have an opportunity just go for it blindly (except photographers).",0 of 1 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

This is a big thing because, before getting this phone she was not that high on the idea of new and upcoming technology ( only because it took her time to understand it.). I can't give a true user review, but my mom looks very happy using it. :) . Also note that i bought a Micromax A1 instead of buying this phone.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,A Very Good Phone.,"This won't be a phone that you fall hard and fast for. It won't sweep you off your feet, nor will it dazzle you with a slew of whizbang features. That's just fine, though. Because none of that changes the fact that the Moto G is still the best budget smartphone you can buy today. Using the thing isn't as revelatory an experience as firing up the new Moto X was, but Motorola's long list of seemingly modest improvements collectively add up to a device that's worth your attention.  It was one of those gadgets that wound up being more than just ""good enough""; between the price and performance, the Moto G was one of the best cheap smartphones you could own, period. I would have myself bought this phone if not for Xiaomi MI3, but since I could not buy it for myself, ended up gifting my Aunt. And it has worked just amazing as well.  The entire functionality makes more sense in the amount of price and features it consolidates for the given structure. And nonetheless, the performance is still beyond mediocre. Its simply stunning. Additionally, the new lollipop features must work equally well ( I haven't made the update as yet, but sure hope to do so.) Th phone is overall brilliantly built for the Indian consumers & I bet you shall like as well.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,3 stars,Best value for money but handle with care,"I purchased moto g2 for my son who is engineering student. Overall the package is very good, look & design, screen resolution, camera, processor speed etc. I liked this phone very much and ordered another for myself (to replace my 2 years old Samsung galaxy ace). After just few days of usage, I dropped the phone accidently (which all phone users will do some or the other day). To my surprise, the much publicized Corning Gorilla glass screen broke into pieces. I have dropped my old phone no. of times but never ended up in this manner. After recovering from this shock, I called Motorola service centre to ask the replacement cost ( I understand well that breakage cannot be covered under warranty). This is the time I got next shock, replacement cost is 7000, i.e. more than 50% of the phone value. It was too difficult for me to spend another 7000 within one month of spending 13000 on new phone. Now I am again using my old phone, need few days to make up my mind. Motorola shall advise customers on fragile nature of screen & heavy replacement cost. Special protection screen can also be recommended so that the customers do not blame Motorola at later stage for keeping them in dark. I will request customers to make informed choice, no doubt this is an excellent phone (deserve 5 stars) but if you ever drop this (or any other phone with glass screen), be ready for spending a large sum.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,4 stars,Great Product for the price range,Using this phone for more than a month.  Pros: Price - No other device comes close in offering the same features for that price range Decent processor - no lag so far on medium gaming. Call Quality - didn't have any issues with noise / re-sound Screen size and its 720p resolution  Neutral : Speakers - not loud enough - but managable Can't comment on expandable memory / camera - as I don't have much use for them.  Cons: Battery - Continuous gaming drains the batter in < 5hrs. Also charging takes around 3 hours. Head phones - nothing great about them. Definitely not suitable for listening to songs/videos. USB connector to PC is not available in the package.  Cool device in the price range - Go for it !!  Also flipkart's delivery is spot on for one-day delivery.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,4 stars,"Good quality phone, low battery life","I have been using the phone for the last 2-3 months and it has been a satisfactory experience so far. The phone is handy and just about fits in shirt or trouser pockets. The display is crisp and resolution is quite high. If you set the brightness on auto then it will adjust to a variety of light conditions so that the screen always remains readable - unlike a few other sets I have seen where the auto setting does not give good results. Readability under direct sunlight is pretty good.  The sound quality is okay. It is not as good as, say, a Sony Xperia, but still the speaker output is okay. The sound does start to crack if you listen at full volume. Sound output to a headphone is much better.  Battery life tends to be poor. I am a moderate user, and never play games on my device or browse for long sessions. I use it with wifi though, and the battery hardly lasts for one full day. But today I got the Lollipop 5.0.2 upgrade, so lets see if the battery life improves. Overall I am quite satisfied with the phone.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,2 stars,Some Major issue faced by me,"The phone clarity, touch, flipkart delivery, everything is good, but major problem I am facing is the POOR NETWORK catching capacity of my phone.It goes out of coverage at places where other phones on same network have complete coverage. moreover it disconnects the ongoing call if the network drops suddenly, while other phone would just maintain the call even though we may not be able to talk and revive as the network is received.Because of this a fresh call has to be started which cause loss of money of one call.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,4 stars,Best in its range,Cons:  High Usage of 3G or wifi-hotspot or gaming drains battery too fast.  Look is not much encouraging while comparing Sony/HTC products but which costs more  If switched off while Battery is under ~3% requires a lot of patience/effort to start the mobile again while charging... I think its not getting started till your battery reaches level 10% which sucks sometime.  Pros:  I like the Camera & Talk to me feature while driving & @home.

Pros: 1) Look and feel of the phone is awesome. Phone looks very beautiful from the front and back with sleek design and amazing finishing. 2)Screen: The screen is very vivid and very smooth with Gorilla glass 3(but it is not scratch proof).It has an amazing colour punch.  3)Camera-Both the front and back camera is very good.Picture quality is very sharp and colour tint and quality of the pictures are very rich.Low light pictures are also good .  4)Processor:processor is good.No lag still now.I have already installed many apps.   5)Signal strength is very good.  6)It has a solid Build Quality.  7)Gaming and HD Video recording is not excellent but it is good and met my expectation is certainly better than samsung phones under 20 K  8)16 Gb internal memory and applications take less phone memory when transferred to external memory card since the android is vanilla and original from google in the device like nexus.  9)Speakers is simply superb and video call quality is also very much satisfatory  Cons: 1) Battery back up is not as good as moto g 1. But it is still good. 2)File manager is not delivered here.And pictures canot me moved directly from the gallery.Either You have to connect to PC or have to download a file manager. 3)Very bad Ear phone  4) I really doubt its hardness...I am sure it is not like galaxy grand or other samsung /Nokia device,You have to use it delicately 5) There is no data cable provided in the box It is an amazing phone from worlds first mobile phone manufacturer.Only through online sell It has spreasd like hell.You can go for it blindly.",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Then i contact to customer care and then not ready to listen my concerned and they give some resolution date  Flipkart Customer Service for OD201236456567124000  and give 3 date one by one  23 Dec 2014 27 Dec 2014 16 Jan 2015 23 Jan 2015  And today i got the call from FlipKart that they ll not help me l just I need to touch with Motorola Service center.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,1 star,Volume Button is not Working properly-Moto G (2nd Gen),"I am using MotoG 2nd Gen for last 10 days. Volume button is not at all working.Looks like manufacturing defect . Volume is increasing and decreasing without touching on this Volume Button. Battery backup is poor. No Data\Charging USB Cable provided with this phone. We need to spend money again for this. Nowadays even Rs.5000 Smart phones are coming with USB data cable and support.  Requested for a replacement from Flipkart. Let me try with a new piece. Courier service of Flipkart is worst. Every time they are sending an sms in the morning saying that your packet will get delivered today before 07.00PM. But they used to deliver the item after 3 days. Reason said that, courier boy doesn't have a mobile phone with STD facility. They can call and deliver only for their customers, who has a local mobile number. Be careful Flipkart customers,you must have a local mobile number(without adding ""0"" before number) for getting proper delivery of your Orders!!! Even these courier Boys are not capable of reading address properly!! It's a so Funny Right????",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

They took 1 month to delivered Moto G 2nd generation to Agra. And i found that Moto G 2nd Gen Phone what i received was damaged, Not working properly and Battery is not working correctly. Shame on you Flipkart. The most interesting fact is that, If I called customer care they don't have any solution for my problem and just always giving me false statement that your product we will delivered soon. Now I don't know what will they do to replace my Moto G 2nd Gen phone. Because while delivery Flipkart has such a bad service, So i have to think about replacement policy with worst customer care service of Flipkart. Do you know when i called customer for my phone delivery status, they always told me that your phone we will be delivered soon and please call courier comply(first), I tried with hundreds times to called them but that worst courier company didn't receive my call. So you guys decide how we can believe on Flipkart for their services and product quality.  @ Flipkart Team :- If you really feel shame on you guys then please track all those kind of bulshit's and make out any realistic solution so that your customer will think to come back to you.

Flipkart exchanged my mobile but I was still facing the same issue with 2nd device. I got to know about FB official page and posted my issue it got fixed by following simple clear partition cache steps. I've also contacted moto support. These guys provide really a great support chat and call also they do access mobile remotely to fix any issue. Not sure if any one else support this way. Talking about the feature, good cam clarity, very simple navigation, looks good with descent battery backup. Until now I've not seen any lags while using the app. However, I've seen most issue fixed by contacting support or from official page on fb.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,The Best Smart phone in 13k Range,I have been using this since 20 days and my Experience has been awesome . To be frank I wanted to go with HTC620 G . Bit in the I decided not to .I consulted many of friends who bought this phone before making the purchase . Now I feel that I made the right decision by buying this phone .  Pros Of the Phone 1. Excellent Display 2. Stereo Speakers for all the music lovers  3. Both the cameras are really good . 4. Built in apps of the Motorola like assist Help me a lot 5. Very user friendly .I did not Dave any difficulty in setting up my mobile.  Cons  1. The battery lasts for a day but I wish the mah was bit more  Overall this is really awesome phone at this price range. Eben though many Chinese companies are trying to woo customers by giving at very low rates but in the long run thru won't survive the competition.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,best smartphone at this range,"I bought a moto g and 2 moto g 2nd phones.  Motorola have best smartphones for each budget.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,You won't regret buying this brilliant device.,"If you're looking for a solid android device, that will perform consistently for a long period of time, look no further. Just go ahead and buy Moto G2.  BUILD QUALITY : 9/10 : It is simply one of the best built products in the price range. The device looks premium and is a joy to hold in hand. Although i'll have to say the buttons could've been designed a bit better, but it's still excellent.   SOFTWARE : 10/10 : This part of the story is just brilliant, Moto g2 gives you that vanilla android experience at half the cost of a nexus device. There are a few motorola apps, which are simply brilliant in it's own way, Moto assist is one of my favorite apps, but it won't be there as we update to lollipop as motorola has a policy of not duplicating inherent features of android, and the functionality that moto assist provides us is present by default in lollipop. S/W is one of the best selling points of this device. I still haven't received the lollipop update, but i believe that motorola is fixing some bugs, and it is rest assured that we'll receive a solid update soon.   CALL QUALITY : 7/10 : I'm not sure if it's a s/w issue, but the speaker volume while you're in call is somewhat low, i discovered in some forums that it is clearly an OS related issue and it is much better in lollipop, however it is not bad at all, it is only marginally low. Noise cancellation is perfect, and the end user almost has a crisp and clear output.   AUDIO QUALITY : 9/10 : It has one of the best stereo outputs, ofcourse not as good as HTC boom sound, but it is certainly loud, and clear too. With certain optimizations, you can make it even better, which won't be necessary as it is excellent by default.   SCREEN QUALITY : 9/10 : The screen is very important in a display of this size, i'll have to say that you'll absolutely love the display, it's sharp and colourful. You won't notice any pixelation during normal usage, The brightness levels are great, and it is decent in outdoor usage. The bezels are small for this device, so the screen looks even more bigger that it really is. It really is a beautiful screen.   CAMERA/VIDEO : 7/10 : It certainly is not one of the best camera phones out there, but it's no slouch, the best part about moto g2's camera is how responsive it is, the auto focus and shutter speed is amazing, it's so snappy!. I absolutely love it. The images are not bad either, it is good enough for a smartphone, besides if you're so keen on getting print ready high quality images, you better look for a DSLR.   OVERALL : 9/10 : It's a brilliant device, if you want a device that offers you everything necessary and doesn't compromise on anything, just go ahead and buy it. You won't regret it!.   Motorola Rocks!.",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,1 star,Poor Experience with this mobile - Rating -5 (Minus 5),"I am repenting buying this mobile set. Absolutely poor performance. Firstly the handset delivered in the first instance was defective. The Second handset works fine but two key defects of this mobile are: 1. Battery backup is pathetic as compared to the mAh and the claims. 2. While you are speaking on the phone, other person can be clearly heard by nearby people. Even from a distance of 5 mtrs. There is no privacy using this phone.  Both this defects were observed in both the handsets I received. Hence conclude this to be a major defect with this phone.

I again requested Flipkart to correct the same, executive assured me that it will be corrected, but next day again, I received sms & call for delivery item on the same day !  I inquired about the issue to customer care, where they told delivery can not be done later, if you want to product, take it now or else it will be returned to Warehouse. This was seriously ridiculous !  Even Flipkart's delivery person does not have any manner to speak with a client.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,3 stars,Moto G [2nd Gen] After 3 Months of Usage,"Been using the phone since 2nd week of October. Value for money, but wouldn't mind if the package was a little better even if that meant shelling out 3-4000 more. It has developed considerable lag in performance, although I'm not into gaming or watching videos on phone. Biggest disappointment is the audio performance, even original Moto G packs in a better punch. Still on Kitkat 4.4, as Lollipop is not yet rolled out. But, I've my doubts whether it would be capable to run Lollipop at all given the latter being graphics heavy. Overall okayish.",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase
Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,1 star,Defective product delivered twice!,"I read the reviews, mostly were positive. It gained praise everywhere! I ordered the product on 6th Jan, but there was problem with the stereo speakers/earpiece, there was buzzing sound, no matter what I played. Secondly, when I would play songs/movie/games etc. with the AUX port to my BOSE stereo, the sound would play for 3secs and pause for 1sec, I literally recorded the time with a stopwatch, and this was perennial, which was irritating. I returned the product on 8th Jan and received replacement on 11 Jan, and the replaced product had the same problems like the returned one. Finally, I returned the product and got refund. I was expecting a lot from Motorola after Lenovo took over it, but again a cheap product at great price!

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,3 stars,Moto G(2nd Gen) Review,Well friends Moto G(2nd Gen) is an excellent phone for low budget buyers.Its specifications are really amazing and worth the money that you spend.My honest feedback to the manufacturer would be to improve the battery back up of this phone as it drains out very quickly and also it gets heated up quickly as well.It is almost a google phone and has all inbuilt google apps already installed and just needs to be synced to start using it.Overall i am happy to recommend this phone to my friends.,0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

I think these phones are trying  to modify the voice quality a lot at the receiver's end that does not works so great with  conference calls.

I took my hands on the phone and it really met my expectations. Smoother! Faster! Soon i installed whatsapp and started texting my friends...Oh! Wait! what's happening there? I noticed that upon pressing a key once, it was taking multiple inputs. To replicate this behavior, i tried it with other apps too (messages and hangouts). The same behavior! I went to a friend after 2-3 days who also owns this phone and tried to type in his phone. It worked fine. I realized that the phone is faulty, and took no time to call the Flipkart Customer Care. They asked me to try some troubleshooting steps, but it didn't work. So I asked them to process the replacement. The next day, Flipkart guy took the old set and gave me the new one.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,1 star,FRAGILE SCREEN,"I received the product on 14th Jan, and today on the 17th the phone fell from less than a metre distance and the screen smashed. The Moto customer care agents told me the repair would cost nearly Rs. 7000 which is more than half the price of the phone itself. Needless to say I won't be availing that service for a 13K phone.   Extremely disappointed with the fragility of the phone. The much hyped toughness of the Gorilla Glass is absolutely false. The authorized service centre people actually redefined the special quality of Gorilla Glass to mean: ""It'll work even if it's cracked"" which is absolute bollocks.It does not matter what the performance specs are if the body isn't solid. The HD display isn't much use through the cracked screen. My first choice was an Asus Zenfone 5, which is 3000 Rs. cheaper than Moto, I extended my budget to buy this one just for the quality.  I also read that Moto replaces the screen for the first time after a damage but only if it's purchased through the Moto website. Obviously that option isn't available in India. Why the hypocrisy? Absolutely disappointed in Motorola products and services.",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Phone worked well for 3 months but after 3 months I noticed a spot on my LCD screen especially on white back ground. I complained to Motorola online support they asked me to write to there customer care email-id which asked me to take phone to service center.   After being tossed around I got my phone to service center. To my surprise service center person said please leave the phone for 5 days to replace the LCD. My livelihood depends on phone hence I asked for replacement which it denied. I asked server center to order LCD and when available I will come and get it replaced which was again turned down.   Surprising I also wrote to Motorola customer care they are also no willing to help.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,Moto G2 vs Lenovo S850 trusted comparison,I have both Moto g2 and Lenovo S850 . Both in White colour .  In terms of beauty both are good but S850 is little better because of back glass .  In terms of handling moto g2 is better fit in hand bkz of curve but its back pannel in white colour can get dirty easily . Performance wise both are equal though both got different processors . antutu scores are same . Camera is better in Lenovo S850 but moto g2 is good too . In software department moto g2 is winner bkz of lolipop update coming which i think lenovo will not release . Battery backup is good in both devices but as far i have noticed Lenovo S850 gives littel more backup though it has Mediatek processor . But despite of mediatek processor S850 gives more batter backup i don't know why even in power saving off . Network issue of S850 is solved when u update and turn off power saving mode . In display both are good but white is more white in S850 and moto g2 have a little yelloyish colour and brightness is more in S850 . I like both devices but for camera and specially Macro shots S850 is best but for latest OS and large developer support Moto G2 is best . Hope this review helps someone . Based only on my experience of 4 months with S850 and 7days with Moto G2 And last thing White colour is better in Moto g2 bkz in black colour u get confused which side is upside because no front camera and sensor is visible . And for selfies choose S850 .,0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase
Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,4 stars,Loving the phone...!!,"I am using this device for about 20 days. The phone is working awesome. Has got an excellent display and is worth the price. Flipkart service is as usual - great. The cell phone will pose a problem to those who keep their wifi or internet data on for a long time because the battery life is average, However on average usage it lasts long. You lose almost zero battery power in stand by. Reviews over forums say that it can run 720p and 1080p videos flawless, but you have to use mx player for doing so and that too in S/W decoder mode.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,4 stars,"Second Moto G in a year, still meh","First of all, this phone is excellent value for the price. However, if you are looking at the Moto G because it's the only Dual SIM phone with clean firmware (no vendor crap), prepare to be disappointed. The Moto G still has only 1 GB of RAM, so if you return to the home screen after a long time in an app (Chrome, WhatsApp, etc), it'll show you a blank wallpaper for 3-4 seconds while it reloads.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,1 star,Motorola - beware - service pathetic,"bought the product in Oct, 2014 for its value for money features. great piece. every thing fine, for the past one month, i am experiencing pain in my ear and side of the head if i speak for even a few seconds. its a dual sim, but i use only one sim. i don't have any other number. contacted the service centre, where they informed even without checking the product, that it is a ear speaker problem. i will have to leave the product with them for seven days. if after changing the ear speaker, it is found that there is some other issues, then you will have to leave the phone for further seven days. because, the guy at the counter did not bother even to check the phone physically before advising for a new ear speaker. Actually, i wanted to know if it had anything to do with SAR. contacted the customer care who were of no use. none of them could help me. my query was why do they require seven days to change the ear speaker. they informed that the indent would be made after i deposit the phone with them. can't they make an indent on the basis of the imei no. of my phone and on receipt of the same, call me for replacement.  i requested the call centre executive to escalate the matter so that i could speak to some responsible person, who can solve the issue. they gave me a Customer Reference number :150111-000474 for the service call i made on 10.01.2015 (8.07 pm) with an assurance to arrange a call back within 48 hours. i'm still waiting for the call. today is 16.01.2015 evening 8.05 pm.  No doubt, it is a great phone. but if the after sales service is pathetic, i feel it is not worth what they purport it to be.  kindly keep the after sales service issue in mind before opting for a motorola phone here in India.  phone - value for money ***** service - pathetic",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,MID- range worthable mobile,"1. Screen: Nice, crisp and vivid, but only 720p. With Snapdragon 400, I guess 720p makes more sense than 1080p. It is 5 inches in size but feels compact and usable in single hand. 2. Performance: Android 4.4.4 comes pre-installed. Lag-free so far. Runs Riptide GP pretty well. Should run all games meant for Snapdragon 400. MS Office, Facebook and Google Drive all work fast and fine.  3. Sound: The front dual speakers are awesome. Very nice sound. None of the other Motos (E/G/X) so far had this kind of fidelity.  4. Camera: 8 MP main cam & 2 MP front. Very good snaps so far both indoors and outdoors. Got only 20 mins to experiment :) 5. Call quality: 2 mics with noise cancellation and a loud speaker! Feels good. 6. Micro SD Slot: This is the greatest inclusion. Moto G sorely missed that. Good option. 7. What else do you want? :) C'mon guys what else do you expect from a phone at this price point? It won't cook your meals or solve your financial problems. Use it practically. It's a good deal.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,Very Good Delivery and good phone,"This phone is one of the best at its price. It is very much worth buying. A quad core, 5 inch display is brilliant. Pixels in the screen seems to be visible under sunlight without the screen switched on which might irritate a few. A scratch guard might prevent it. Better hold the phone before buying, if your friends have it well and good, cause the size of the phone might be a matter for people with small sized fingers.The phone might be slippery without a grip case or cover even though there seems to be a desperate try for a mate finish back cover. Don't worry if the phone is dropped down as the gorilla glass works quite well :) Soon to come lollipop software update which works at 60 frames per second and its material design is very attractive which is available for few moto devices and nexus devices at such a soon stage. People wanting to buy Nexus devices or devices which contains stock or near to stock OS are recommended to buy this device.You dont find much of a lag in this device as there aren't any software modifications in it. But 4 to 5 apps running at the same time.. you are sure to experience 1 to 2 seconds wait during swapping between minimized windows. The front dual speakers which is very attractive in this device does not offer beats level audio but is really not bad.   All in all good phone.. dont have money.. not planning on a n asus zenfone 5 or a nexus or a micromax.. GO FOR THIS!! =D",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,4 stars,1 Week Review,"Hello Guys First Impression - At first Phone is quite impressive fast, good screen and fits in hand perfectly as it is 5.0"" display phone before using this phone i am personally afraid of large screen phone, bad ear phone, and charger should come in black with black coloured phone.  Review - After ordering it from flipkart i have been reading reviews it till the day got my product and lot of people yelling about slow charging issues & low battery backup. I am mid core user likes to play games that too heavy one like Injustice, etc., love to stream music on-line , watch videos with all these things casually with some calls and all day on WiFi my phone makes it upto 12 hrs on average. So regarding charging issue during my first charge with stock charger provided it do charge slow but when i use a Samsung charger it charges very fast so it seems charger provided in the box is not good at all. The ear phone provided with the phone is also not good at all, i have seen some pretty good earphones come with the box specially HTC stocks one are very good but so i opt back to my old Sennheiser headphone. With respect to the size of the phone, battery have to be at least 2500 mah, screen quality is good with a little blue tone which will you not notice with regular usage but the screen readability is not good in sunlight. Screen should have little more brightness. I also seen some users complaining about some crackling sound while playing music in full volume from front speakers but it appears to the quality of music file you are playing. In some songs i feel it in some songs i won't. Software - Stock android is always good so on the device it also works good on the phone. I personally didn't like default launcher i.e.. Google Now Launcher, as icons appear very large on screen and eating up a huge screen space so I installed nova launcher it works fine and runs pretty fast and smooth. Screen Rotation Toggle button is missing from quick settings so you have to use third party software for that like ""Notification Toogele"". Phone Comes with all the stock apps with some Motorola apps pre-installed. And it is upgradable to lolipop and soon upgrade will be released by this Jan.

But quality of accessories is not really good.  First is headphones, when you are purchasing branded thing it is expected that thing like color is not going to be the problem. But Motorola has provided me white color headphones with black color handset. This combination looks really ugly.  Second is charger, charger pin is not standard for Indian socket, its thickness is smaller than socket diameter, so connectivity is not good while charging. You need adapter for the same.  Third is data cable, this is really ridiculous than all smart phone makers are providing data cable and when you are purchasing 10000 plus handset it is expected that Motorola should provide at least data cable.",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,4 stars,Great phone at a great price.,"I generally do not write reviews. But since I read a lot of reviews, I thought of writing one so that others can know the product better.  I have received the Moto G 2nd Gen phone from Flipcart on 10th Oct, 2014. It is really an excellent phone. I use the phone to check emails in multiple accounts of mine and it simply works great. Video quality is good, though call quality could improve a lot given the reputation of Motorola. My Samsung phone which is an old one has better call quality than the Moto phone. Battery life is average and can really be rated on the less than average size. Moto could have done well with a better battery. Processor is fast and the best part of the phone is its camera which takes clear pics. Even pictures taken in dark are quite good.  Overall a good buy at this price.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,4 stars,Great phone!,Exchanged this with a Samsung Galaxy S+ in the December offer.  A few things that are a sore:  1. No easy way to select a mp3 as your ringtone  2. There is no downloads folder that stores the media files you transfer from a computer. They will be visible in the file list of players like MX/VLC  3. It is not very easy to find the settings option in most tabs/apps. Was very convenient in the Galaxy S+  Other wise.. full marks to the phone.  Great Sound quality - It is stereo when watching movies/listening to songs/playing games  Great Picture quality   Large enough screen  Very good battery life  Camera could have been better.

Number of clicks required to reach some basic features such as turning Wi-Fi on/off, Volume control, Speed Dial are not easy here.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,4 stars,Moto G (2nd Gen),Bought this phone from Flipkart on 18th Nov 2014 and I am very happy with the overall performance of this phone. Its got a good 5 inch IPS display and the images are pretty sharp.The call quality is very good with no call drops whatsoever.The camera is amazing considering its an 8MP one. I was particularly impressed by the overall sharpness of the images produced by the camera. The battery is 2070 mAh and its lasts me almost more than a day with normal usage.The overall design of the phone is good and it does not feel bulky at all and fits in comfortably in shirt and pant pockets. That could be perhaps due to the curved back that the design incorporates.The best part about this phone is its Android L compatible and the update to Android L is just around the corner.  Overall I would say its a very good phone for the price and Moto has really done a good job. Go for it!

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,4 stars,"Value for money, lives up to its expecations, but.....","No doubt, the Moto G Gen 2 is a great budget smart phone with features typically available on a high end phone.  I have migrated from an iPhone 5 to the GG2, and I had zero expectations with Android after being an Apple guy since 2007 (I have only had apple devices all of em in fact). Moto did a fabulous job of migrating from the iCloud all my data. it was very simple to move to Android.  It is all what they say in reviews across multiple channels and websites. But, but but there is one small problem, and that's the stock charger you get in the kit. It is a very slow process to charge your Moto GG2 from 20% battery to a 100%. It takes 6 hours uninterrupted without any wireless connections on.  So I bought a MicroUSB cable (as its not included in the kit), and used some of existing blackberry and iPhone charging base, here are results:  1. Stock Charger from Moto : 3.6 minutes for 1% to charge (6 hours total charge time) 2. Blackberry charging base + Micro USB cable : 2.20 minutes for 1% to charge (4.20 hours total charge time) 3. IPhone charging base + Micro USB cable : 2.0 minutes for 1% to charge (3.5 hours total charge time)  So you can see, that you need to throw the kit charger into the dustbin and get a better charger. But it is no where near an iphone's charging capabilities of a near full charge under and hour and thirty minz.",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Secondly,the first few months would be like a cake but after few months your phone is going to lag,BEWARE! 1GB of ram isn't enough,but what else do you expect in the price? Thirdly,Motorola service centres are very limited and whichever are there with flipkart records(ALL THE PHONE NUMBERS ARE WRONG) Lastly,while purchasing it said guaranteed LOLLIPOP UPDATE! I got my phone in October and up till now,ie January beginning to end,I haven't received any update?

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,2 stars,Go for Asus Zenfone 5 Instead,"I've used both Moto G IInd Gen and Asus zenfone 5. The performance of zenfone 5, i can doubtlessly say, is much much better than Moto G IInd. The main drawback is its low RAM. Many tasks get stopped while in the background. At normal use the free RAM is about 180MB which is very very low as compared to zenfone 5 which has about 1.2GB free RAM at normal use. Also, in price factor, Zenfone 5 is much better. Camera, is also better in zenfone 5. The benchmark scores of nenamark 2, quadrant standard and others are a way much better for zenfone 5. Even zenfone 4 beats moto g IInd in benchmarks. Only in looks is moto g IInd beter than zenfone 5. Zenfone 5 looks a bit large in size.",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,Better than the BEST,"This is my second Motorola Phone. Bought this after my MOTO G was stolen. Decided to stick to the MOTO phone due to its unmatched performance and premium feel, and i am really happy with the New Moto G ( 2nd Gen). Everyone has written about the phone, so i dont think i need to mention all the pros and cons all over again.  For those guys who are confused between this and Asus Zenfone 5:  * Go for Moto G Gen 2, though the camera is not as great as asus, but the lifeline (battery) of the phone is great, and this can save your life in difficult situations!  Experience with Flipkart Return / Service: * Sadly the phone i received was faulty ( The second sim card slot was not functioning properly and The Power button was faulty ) * I Called up on the flipkart Toll Free number and spoke to the CSR, she was really helpful and placed a Replacement request. * Within a day, i got my faulty phone replaced by a New Handset.",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Happy New Year Everyone I have been using this product for a month i ordered it on 1 december 2014 and recived it on 6 december 2014 thanks to flipkart for delivering the phone on time so first thing about the phone when you look at it is that it's build quality build quality is realy good it does not look cheap phone motorola has doen a great job with that if you are using the first gen of this phone then processing wise both are same had same chipset of 1.2Ghz qualcomm quad core processor 1 Gb ram so if you have the first gen motorola moto g don't buy 2nd gen 2.The phone has upgrades like the 5-inch HD screen but it is not full HD it is 720p HD resolution another thing it has a memory card slot which we don't have in first gen moto g and expandable up to 32GB  3.Camera performs it has 8mp rear camera and 2mp front camera rear camera is good in day light and also low light imaging is very well motorola has upgraded this camera and it is good but it takes some time to focus in artificial light front camera is good but when you take selfie's with it it produces shakey images both the camera can take video's in 720p HD and it also has a slow motion  with 720p HD resolution  4.Gaming the device can handle high graphics game like asphalt 8 etc.But the phone gets heat up while playing games the stereo speakers perform very well and produce good sound 5.Display is 5 -inch HD display which has 720 X 1280 pixels resolution it is an IPS LCD screen with 5 inches in size 6.Battery is of 2070 mAh same as the first generation but is ok for this phone works all working day  7.It also supports OTG USB device very smoothly  8.Graphics are realy good adreno 305, 450MHz single core 9.Os is kitkat 4.4.4 with upgrade of 5.0  *Cons of this device are 1.First it should have atleast 1.5 GB ram 2.It should have more battery it is 15% less than the first gen moto g because of 5 inch screen 3.Front camera could have been improved  4.It some times needs more time to shift apps while multitasking  5.It's brousing speed decreases with 5-4 tabs running at a time  6.using camera for about 10 to 15 min decreases the battery percentage 7.As above mention the device heats up while gaming",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,4 stars,Great phone for the price!,"I bought the phone because my galaxy s4 screen cracked. I got so sick and tired of manufacturers loading their bloatware and themed skins on top of the beautiful android interface. I also absolutely love on-screen navigation buttons. I would never go back to capacitive buttons or hard buttons again!  This phone is guaranteed to get the Android Lollipop update in the coming weeks. What I love about the phone is its fluidity and battery life. However, since it is running stock android, I was disappointed because a lot of convenient CM11 features were missing. Things like not being able to customize the notification pull down menu, torch quick toggle etc. However these issues will be corrected once Lollipop is out as it borrows and improves upon a lot of features in CM11. Also, it would have been nice if it came with a multicolored notification LED :(   The HD screen is sharp at normal viewing distance. I was honestly worried about whether I wouldn't like the downgrade from a 440ppi screen to a 300ppi screen. I'm happy to say that anything more than 300ppi is unnecessary as you won't be able to tell the difference 99% of the time and unless you hold a 440ppi screen right next to it.  The only problem with the screen is that its not as nice as an AMOLED display. Although I appreciate the brightness of the LCD panel, i hate using it in bed due to the poor viewing angles. Tilt the phone too much and you start seeing the glow from the backlight emanating from the screen. It absolutely annoys me and it sometimes induces motion sickness.  I hate how stupid the dual speakers look like. They could have been smaller... it makes the phone look like a plastic toy. The phone would have looked better if they just designed the speakers to look like grills instead of a bar.  Anyways all in all its a fantastic phone. I don't have too many regrets except for the points stated above. But then again, I am paying only 13k for it and it is a bargain!",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase
Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,bang for the buck,"I have used this product for 2 weeks and am sharing my experience. I have chose this over others as it is an all-rounder.  Build and looks-The ergonomics are good and does not feel very thick due to its curved design. It looks more like a 30k phone than a 13k phone  Display-The display is crisp and has natural colours. Text is clearly visible in bright sunlight. It does not need a scratch guard as it is protected y gorilla glass  Cameras-Both the front and back cameras are amazing in outdoors as well as indoors  Storage-We have 16gb internal storage out of whick about 12gb is available. In the generation of 128gb expandable storage, motorola is only providing 32gb expandable storage which is a minor con  Battery life-It is good enough to last you a whole day of normal usage   RAM-It is very less and can be clearly noticed while doing multitasking. I wouldnt mind payong 2k more for 1.5gb ram  Sound-The front facing speakers provide a good audio effect but it is not very loud. Even call quality is very good  UI and updates-It runs on the google now launcher which is very smooth. Even software updates are guaranteed for about 18 months. Still waiting for android L though  Ignoring its cons considering the price of the phone it is awesome for the price.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,4 stars,"Very good phone, but...","I had to apply for a replacement as in the phone I received, the notification panel would not slide down at times. You had to lock and unlock the phone for the problem to be solved but it would reoccur. So if that's the case in your phone too, apply for a replacement as the problem has been listed in the Motorola forums and everyone facing it has got a replacement.  Here I'm listing only some of the cons of the device that I received after replacement:  ->The lock key and volume button of the phone are not sturdy. They are loose and move sideways.  ->The sensor of the phone I received seems to be defective. When during a call, I need to switch on a feature like speaker or open the dialing pad the phone screen goes off as soon as I try to touch it and comes on again when I move my finger away which is very annoying. I just hope that the problem doesn't become worse :(  MOST IMPORTANT NOTE: I really doubt that Flipkart gives you a brand new product when you go for replacement. The phone I received after replacement showed signs of being used earlier although it was a completely packed piece. It must have been returned earlier by someone. So I would say that as far as possible try not to go for replacement as it is more probable that you may get an even worse product. Therefore, I would say that getting a perfectly working product without any defect in the first go is pure luck.",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,Excellent Phone,"I am using this phone about 2-3 months.It is really amazing and battery performance is also good and picture and video clarity is superb.specially front camera is good for self's. As it is a 5 inch phone so it portable and fits anywhere in the pocket. And we can play games like temple run,subway surface etc, without any lag.and I also watch HD (high defination) videos on it and the video clarity is also good. I found only one problem with this phone is that the front camera is good but it sometimes it lags but it is good for video call and normal photo it very high clarity photos. So I give it a rating of 4 star . And flipkart 's packing is also good and delivery is also very fast. I recommend you all to buy this phone from Flipkart.com thank you !",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,4 stars,Average phone,Pros Superb body & design ; dont need a cover to protect it unless you want to be too protective Speaker volume : Its more than expected Exchange : This is biggest advantage. My earlier xolo mobile battery was swollen 1 and half year hence in exchange I got good branded phone. Next android version: I dont know how would next version be but atleast i can upgrade by phone  Cons Battery life : Its less but atleast you can use battery saver mode. You need to find ways to save battery. Full day use will drain out battery in 8-10 hours Ear phones ; Quality is average. Could have been better. Connector : The charger does not include the connector. I was fortunate enough to have a connector of old phone  I am giving 4 star just because it is Motorola.....else this is 3 star quality phone,0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,The all rounder at a great price,Every good thing comes at a big price. Certainly false . just take a look at this phone. I mean just look at it. It's the best phone under 20000. And the thing to be notedis it is one of the lowest in the section too. Really a beauty to use. Pure android with good performance and is real fast. Working on this phone is flawless. The feature of expandable memory has made it almost perfect. But it too has some issues. The build quality is good but its glossy plastic back is still not a winner for all. It's camera which has 8 M is good but not great considering others in this price bracket. Also the screen resolution is not as good as the old moto g due to its larger screen size. But still it is not just good but great at this price. It's performance and the availability of pure Android is its biggest plus point. It's ability to handle high-def games is an added plus. If you have 15000 in your pocket look nowhere else..

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,Good Phone - Value for Money,"Fundamentally I am Apple fan! Started with shuffle and now have an iPhone, 2 iPads etc. But wanted a second phone hence thought of Moto G 2nd Gen, off course after lot of research. I will split my feedback in three areas: 1. Flipkart Service - well excellent, you buy they deliver on time or before time. 2. Moto G phone: I am using this for a month now, excellent phone. But it took me time to get used to an ""non Apple"" phone. Initially was frustrated with sound quality, but realised that I have to hold it at a particular place and way and boom the sound was excellent. The battery was also a huge issue, draining at a speed higher than one can charge. Then I spent good amount of time on switching off all unnecessary things on the phone and the battery backup has been optimised to an extend that I have to charge once in two days. This is for full usage for its purpose i.e several con calls, email updates etc. I also used Jabber to login to meetings where the PPTwas being shared with the call, which means very heavy usage of net to display ppt and the call, worked very well as equivalent to my Apple, the display is slightly better. I deleted all unwanted preloaded applications and stopped a few, this optimised the storage. I loaded all those applications that I usually use but still the external 16 GB remains up utilised. The front and back camera are very good, it feels very comfortable to hold as well. My conclusion, you have to optimise the phone and learn to use it, and this becomes an excellent phone. 3. This is where the conflict, after using Apple IOS from the begning(I shifted from NOKIA very old hand set to iPhone 4s) I am finding android very clumsy and confusing. Simple example, if I have to switch off all notifications at one go, I can do that at one go in Apple, but in android I have to visit each app separately.  My final verdict: if you want and excellent phone for usual office use with all relevant apps go for Moto G 2nd gen. Purely from operational perspective it is excellent value for money. Disclaimer: Apple vs android is my personal opinion/perception, and hence I do not want to argue which one is better.",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,"Moto G:G For Genius,From Genius","This is my Review for Moto G2 after using it for 2 months  Display: It has good display.Video quality is very sharp with great brightness. Despite having gorilla glass 3 i have got a very small scratch on screen near bottom speaker.Great sensitivity , moto has rocked it. 5inch display is perfect for one hand use.  Camera: Rear Camera of moto g2 is decent than many other phones in same price range. Camera interface is simple,effective and very easy to use.You need accurate settings for best pics from g2.Flash with auto settings hardly works so its up to u to keep it on or off. Front Camera is 2mp which is very below average.It is pretty laggy.Hope they fix it in lollipop update.  Speakers: Call quality is best in G2.With dual front speakers call quality is much better this category and phones in range of 25k-30k. Listening to music is great experiance. Watching video is amazing with front speakers though not as premium as HTC Dual boom speaker phones.  Performance: Best Performance in this category. 1.2ghz processor not the best but great performer as original moto g1. Most of games with medium or high quality graphics played good in likes of Dead Trigger,NFS Most Wanted,Dark Knight Rises,Batman Arkham Origins. Performance gets laggy when 3G downloads are multitasked with games or other apps.  Connectivity: Connectivity of moto g2 is satisfactory.WiFi works great.Bluetooth and Gps work fine. Moto G2 is worst for 2G users.You should either have 3G or WiFi for good,better or best experience on g2. Inbuilt apps like gmail,chrome,firefox,opera,play store,google drive,facebook,Google search dont even work on 2G . They always say no connection with 2G i.e,GPRS or EDGE.  Memory: It has 12gb internal memory.I use that for just Apps. I got myself 32gb sandisk ultra external microSD card in G2 for videos and music.  Software: Pure Android which is just amazing.Using Kitkat 4.4.4 from day one which is great OS especially with phones with 1Gb RAM or less.I thought G2 will get Lollipop update in Nov 2014 but it hasnt arrived yet.Main reason is Motorola's Nexus 6 deal with Google stopping other moto phones from get 5.0.1 andriod update.Just hoping them to give us soon.  Accessories: Headphones provided by moto are worst.They are equal to some china headphones with price 60Rs. on streets.I got myself a skullcandy headphone which works fantastic moto G2.Moto should learn from Sony about providing accessories.  Battery: Worst Battery performance ever is in Moto G2.Its not just my phones , I have seen 2-3 g2's with worst battery performance.If 3G or WiFi is on constantly battery drains very fast.If brightness is medium or high it drains very fast.You need to keep ur phone on 2G for better battery performance but again no many apps work on 2G . With playing high end games battery will come from 100% to 30% in just 1 hour.Battery drains in medium rate during watching HD videos or playing music. You either have to carry charger with u or power bank with you.G2 needs atleast 2 charging for a single day i.e.15 hours with videos,music,3G,wifi,nearing no gaming. Hoping moto to improve battery performance in lollipop update. Motorola forgot that moto g2 is 5inch phone it is not 4.5inch moto g1 with both having same 2070mah battery which is enough for G1 but not enough for G2.  Conclusion: It is great phone at great price with brand value than those who are no brand value like xiaomi or micromax.Good Smartphone go for it.",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,1 star,very poor Moto G 2nd Gen quality,I bought moto g 2nd gen from flipkart and when i switched it on for the first time out of the box i was shocked that it had a screen with yellow tinge instead of white.  i requested replacement from flipkart with request to ensure that the second peice does not come with the same fault.  but my doubt came true as the replaced piece also came with the same hardware fault i.e. screen with yellow tinge.  also after 4 days use the replaced phone's on/off button and volume button have started wobbling and loosely fitted  i don't think they will last more than 6 months.  now again i called flipkart and they asked me to visit service center and told me in clear terms that replacement is not an option unless the service centre acknowledges that there is fault with the screen.  imagine the pathetic logic of flipkart that a customer is asked to go to service centre for a product which was faulty straight out of the box.  now guys the thing is flipkart delivers poor quality product twice and then i am at the mercy of motorola's service centre to get the fault acknowledged..  in short customer is always wrong at first instance unless acknowledged by its brands service centre.  this is the situation shoppers have been facing while shopping in our country whether you buy from a shop in your town or from online site.  i suggest fellow customers to think twice before buying moto g 2nd gen unless they are ok with yellow screen instead of whit and with poorly fitted buttons.  P.S. I compared the screen of both the phones delivered to me with the moto g 2nd gen of my freind who bought it 3-4 months back and he has a perfect white screen.,0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,3 stars,Good phone but has limitations,"I bought this phone on two months back, after lot of research ,reading reviews from flipkart and other phone review sites, but i would like to point out few issues which you will find only after you use and will not find in many review sites. I am an average user, not many games, just online news reading and video watching and general use. Firstly pros- 1. Sleek and attractive design. 2.Good Cam(Above Average, low light images are also decent) 3.Sound clarity good(people had complained about it, but sound is quite loud and enough.) 4.Performance is spectacular,any no. of apps can be loaded and it will perform superbly. Hardly ever the phone had hanged. 5.Display is excellent. 6.GPS is excellent Now, cons: 1. I am not able to save any apps or media on sd card, i don't understand why the provision is there when u can't use it.(of course u can save cam pics and videos on it, but not downloaded videos or music.To do so you have to root the device with some app, but I was sceptical, so i didn't.) 2.Battery backup is the main problem with this phone, if you didnt recharge your phone to full capacity before leaving for office, then you are in trouble.Full battery hardly lasts for 16hrs,(with No data usage, that may be because of connectivity issues). 3.If the phone gets switched off , some times it happens that it will not switch on even after charging for 15-20 mins, apparently there is some calibration problem with the phone.(This u will not find in any review sites.) 4. If the face of the phone is placed touching the body part in pocket, it gets heated up to uncomfortable levels, this is scares me at times. 5. You can't assign your favorite song as ringtone,this is annoying and i dont know why, even basic phones have this facility. 6. I noticed battery performance is good on wifi than on 3g.(this may be common)  It is better to go for lumia phones by spending an extra 2-3k rupees.  Hope this is useful.",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,4 stars,"Very good, worth the price.","Good phone overall, animations lag a teeny tiny bit but you won't notice it unless you're used to 30k phones. I get around 5 hours of screen on time on 3g, which is decent I guess, nothing spectacular. Apps load snappily, but it has only 1 GB of memory so yeah, apps will restart at times while multitasking, if you have a lot of them open. If you like stock android, you'll love this phone. A very good buy for the price.   If you're buying this phone, don't bother getting a screen guard, been using it without one for 3 months and not a single scratch. (This doesn't make it shatterproof though, get a case if you have clumsy hands!). Survived more than a couple of drops, but I doubt if the screen will hold up if I drop it face down, like any other phone it will probably shatter. The screen is sharp, alright in bright light, but viewing angles are pretty poor although it's an IPS LCD. Display colours and crisp and natural looking, no oversaturated nonsense. This is one of the few phones were I noticed the auto brightness works perfectly.  Still waiting for the lollipop update though, you'd think Motorola phones would be the first to receive it (after Nexus) but it's January already. :/",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

After 23 days of usage, touch screen at the bottom does not work and I see in the black background the screen gets fading out. I was very much satisfied with Flipkart since started using from 2012 and nowadays very much totally disappointed with flipkart products about the product quality.   I DOUBT WHETHER FLIPKART IS SELLING GENUINE PRODUCTS or it's Moto G Made in China causing product issues being Flipkart the major imported of Moto products. Have raised a ticket on this issue.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,A superb upgrade.,"got the phone for a 4000 rs discount, thanks a lot flipkart...  firstly the phone is beautifully elegant, the finishing and craftsmanship is very impressive. this give the phone a very polished and a very premium look.  been using it for the past 1 week, and so far enjoying every bit of it..  now a breakup of summary.  PROS:  1>the 294ppi display is a mesmerizing thing to look at, very good viewing angles, and very crisp display. 2> 1.2 GHZ quad core processer is a mighty beast, can run multiple apps without any lag. 3> the Adreno GPU is just a delight, all recent high end games work (but best in medium settings. ) 4> Camera... where do i even begin, the 8MP snapper is the standout feature of this device, can record videos in 720p only but that is not a let down, images captured are brilliant and very much comparable to a low end dslr... the front cam is just the icing on the cake images are just as good. 5> Storage is greatly improved with the provision of SD card Slot. 6> recharging time, is greatly reduced, from a standard charger supplied, the device charges in little less than 90 Mins. a very good thing..  CONS: 1> Battery could have been better, the 2070mah battery last's only for 13-15 hrs, even on moderate internet usage. 2> the Available RAM should have been atleast 1.5 GB, not that it is a major problem ... 3> I noticed the charger heats up at times, not sure if a faulty charger, or due to quick charging...

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,4 stars,Thank God I got a replacement,"I first got this phone delivered to me on 30.12.14 and unfortunately I had to go switch on the Talk Back feature on the phone. Thats it. My phone went for a royal toss and I had to return the product. But hey that happens and Flipkart was just awesome to give me a replacement within the next 2 days. Its a good phone after all. Not every phone works!!  Now that I have my new phone, let me provide my views:-  Pros:-   Smooth and fast browsing (facebook and whatsapp is just super smooth to use) Thanks to Kitkat.  Camera is just awesome (front and back)  Almost every game can be played.  Amazing skype experience.  Voice clarity is simply superb and it doesn't hurt the ear.  The headphones provided serves the purpose really well.  And yes it can be upgraded to Lollipop.  Easy to hold, and mainly easy to type. (Did not find any difficulty)  Huge internal memory of 16GB and SD card upto 64 GB  Cons:-   Battery life is very less. And the fact that it is inbuilt makes it a lot more skeptical. (Make sure you own a power bank).  As mentioned above, DO NOT SWITCH ON the TALK BACK FEATURE.  Getting connected to a computer might be a bit of a confusion at the beginning but I am sure people will get used to it within a day or two.  On the whole a very good product that is worth your money spent!  Go for it. You will not regret!!!!",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

No lag in response found  * Display is of premium quality compared to phones in similar price range  * Pure Android experience ( No much useful apps from MOTO)  * Can't change the font style without rooting , Unlike from Samsung phones  * No Overheating experienced  * 13GB is available for apps ( Theres no app specific memory, user can use  the memory according to them , that is for apps or media.  * Charger that came with the phone is dissapointing as its so slow in charging  (take nearly 4 hours for a full charge) and it heats too much",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,Poor Man's NEXUS 5 which is AMAZING!!,Ordered the phone on 22/Dec/15 and got it in one day 23/Dec/14 I bought this phone in Exchange offer to my old Samsung Galaxy LCD (First Generation). I got 3000 Rs for the old phone which was very good. I have been using this phone for more than a week  PROS: 1) Screen Resolution is Amazing and 5 inch phone looks very good. I have compared it to Nexus 5 and Moto G2 looks 80 percent of Nexus 5 - 5/5 2) Camera clarity is simply mind blowing and its a awesome 8MP Rear camera. - 5/5 3) Front Speakers are good - 4/5 4) Response time is very good and apps open immediately and no lag is found - 5/5 5) Gaming - Played Temple run 2 and subway surfer without any hiccups - 5/5 6) Lollipop - Eagerly waiting for lollipop Upgrade.   CONS: BATTERY: Battery is average. For every 3min of internet browsing you will loose 1% of battery and Moto g 2 should have provided 3000mAH Battery. But is is far better than iphone 4. I have installed Battery Saver App and after that Iam able to control the Battery. Also bought MI Powerbank so Iam relieved and does not have check my battery all the time.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,4 stars,Overall still the best in mid-range smartphones,"I am still a user of the Moto G 1st Gen, I bought the 2nd Gen for my brother.. Obviously G2 is better thanks to its screen size. The only difference between the two phones is the battery backup which is better in the 1st Gen. External slot doesn't really matter, because they DO harm the phone in many ways.   I too would have bought the G2 but what held me back are the speakers.. If Motorola would have continued the same model with just the size update, it would have been so much better. Those speakers are really ugly !! I just hope Motorola Mobility or Lenovo, whoever wears the pants in the family now does not continue with those speakers for the next phone to be released by them, and even if they do please manufacture with a colour like metallic grey which camouflages those speakers.   To sum it up, MotoG2 is still the real MVP !!!",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,Excellent!,"After 6 days of use, I find Moto G is excellent phone by Motorola which is the first company to make cellular phones. Motorola is also American company (recently bought by Google), you can compare its build quality with Apple.  I also happen to have Ipad Mini 2 Retina display.   1. Phone function 5/5   Clear audio quality. I used to get poor signal with my old Samsung Galaxy R at home but now that problem is solved. Thanks to Android 4.4.4 you have simplified view of contacts, call log. But message log and call log are separate. Nowadays sms use is lesser. Hardly anyone mentions this feature which is still very relevant today. Many high end phones have complicated calling function.  2. Display 5/5   294 ppi to be exact. Small fonts can be read without eye strain. My Ipad Mini 2 Retina has 324 ppi and you CAN'T tell difference. Now there are phones with 500 ppi displays, but you won't notice these tiny pixels beyond human eye capacity.  3. Battery 4/5   I get upto 2 days as my use is less. But heavy user can get a day's backup.  4. Camera 5/5   Impressive photos in low light. Takes multiple shots per second!! It makes sure you get a perfect snap in sports or when moving speedily.  5. Original Android, Google now 5/5  6. White LED notification   Good feature for those who don't check phone constantly. You can set for just personal message in WhatsApp or a missed call etc.  7. Build quality 5/5   Better than Samsung, close to Apple but without metallic back.  8. Design 5/5   Slightly curved back with matte finish helps gripping. Phone is not too thin. Too thin phones are difficult to hold. My Ipad is thin and slightly uneasy to hold.  Other important features are Gorilla glass, Android 5 update, Motorola brand. And it is almost a 'budget' phone costing 13k.  Only thing is to be seen is how Motorola service is. I hope it will hardly be needed.",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,4 stars,Decent Phone at its price range,"Bought this on its launch day itself... I've been using for over 3 months.. till now no issues like hanging or heating as such other than battery running out soon when using 3G network.. but that's just androids & Moto's way of telling you keep your charger close by..  phone comes loaded with most of the features which are generally abundant in all other brands so not much to tell.. camera is decent so is the dual stereo speakers.. they are loud but who plays music on mobile phone speakers other than plug the headphones.. the packaging comes very simple & there's no data cable which is a big negative point if you don't have any lying around.. I already had 2-3 so no worries there.. the headphones provided inside are very basic variety you would do better to buy a good one separately, I use Tekfusion Twinwoofers with Poweramp so music listening is awesome...  picture quality is clear & bright even when the brightness is turned down a lot... i dont use any screen guard as the screen comes with gorilla glass 3 which does its work pretty decently... till now no nudges or scratches on the phone or maybe I keep my phone safe from all that..  Flipkart delivery was late by 2 days but packaging was good...  overall a good phone to invest..",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,4 stars,Good smartphone in the price segment with minor but serious drawbacks,"Hello,  It's been more then two months I am using this phone. I am moderate user (not a gaming freek) and the phone is going quite well for me except many minor but irritating drawbacks.  Pros: 1. Master piece in price range 2. Looks extremly good (I baught black color handset with two additional orignal back cover and it looks great) 3. Does'nt hang in moderate usage (m not gaming freek but dozen of app runs in my phone all the time) 4. Latest andriod OS 5. Camera is fast 6. Good quality sound.  Cons: 1. Camera is not great in night/dull light. What it shows in display is not as same as what it captures. 2. Zoom in / Zoom out pinch gesture is irritating and doesn't work smoothly. Issue with the default app. 3. SPEAKERS CANNOT BE TURN ON while listening to RADIO. (not sure if this is the hardware issue or the default app issue) 4. Some time while listening to music on headphones if you eject to move to speakers, it does'nt work or there is a reduction in volume. you need to pause and resume and speakers starts working. 5. Buttons on earphone (call pick/drop/change song/adjust volume) does'nt work. 6. Ear phones shipped with the product is of cheap quality. 7. There is NO NEXTLINE KEY in the keyboard. (not sure it is OS issue, I am usnig 4.4.4) This makes extremly unpleasent while texting.  Thanks!",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

I told in some abc restaurant then they requested we'll come to that restaurant with-in half-an hour not to your address, just coz restaurant is on the way to my home so no need to travel up-to my home (Called at 12:30PM, even they have car) I told okay(I told YES just because they requested a lot). after that I waited 2 hours in that restaurant, They dint come I gone to my home(2PM). After half-an hour(2:30PM) they called and told we'll be at that restaurant with-in 5 minutes. I told I waited for 2 hours now deliver to my home. They told No, If you want come else sorry. We can't come to your address. I gone to that abc restaurant again. There he's scolding me just coz I was not there and told we are gonna return back your product to flipkart by signing ""Customer's Unavailable"" if it happens again. OMG!!! I'm really confused.. In phone he requested he can't come up-to my home address and now he's blaming for the change of address.  I'm really requesting flipkart people to tell Ekart delivery guys Just to deliver to given address not calling and requesting to come to some other places just because they can't travel far. Because we guys are already paid money through Debit/Credit cards and waiting for products. from now on I'll do cash on delivery. If something like this happens next time I'm gonna return the product. In that case blame your delivery guys not buyers.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,4 stars,Awesome Phone,"This is one of the best smart phone in range of 15K. I bought it and I am happy to use it. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 stars because all I needed was an android default launcher for Android vr.4.4.4 but all other moto system upgrades,the default launcher will be replaced with the google now launcher. Although its not a demerit I have checked it completely and found it to be a useful device...   What I checked that other critics or buyers were saying a lot about its low voice from speakers, not so good display and a bad battery backup.   i) My Moto g (2nd Generation) has an awesome display with everything good-> brightness, contrast, colors etc. ii) My Moto G2 has an amazing voice clarity form speakers even if I listen to any music or play any game (RipTide GP 2). iii) My Moto G2 with 100% battery lasts upto 6-8 hours if continuously used. Its a merit cause as fas as I have tested so many android phones, they doesn't lasts for even 5 hours when used continuously.  If you can afford it, then you should buy it, cause its the best among the bests.  Although it has a good competitor that is, hTC 616, but still I'll advice you to buy this.....  As already said that it is, ""Best out of bests"". Even a title to Moto G1 was given by so many magazines and newspapers, it was, ""POOR PEOPLE's NEXUS"", so Moto G2 can be easily titled as ""POOR PEOPLE's NEXUS6 "".   I guarantee.",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Why do i have to make rounds of the service centre every now and then. It was woking properly before giving for servicing, I find here that these are some workmen whom motorola has given authority and they are not exclusively for Motorola.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,*Have a look to my reviews who wanted to buy the phone*,"Fist I have been using micromax canvas 2 A110 for three years, I know what is the bad quality product. That Phone was bad and slow so I got exchange offer I switched it with this GEM. I have used Nexus 5, Grand 2 and Grand 1 for two days each. I think Grand 1 and 2 is no where in competition with this phone. Battery is same to canvas so I know how to use this new phone but it is almost 24 hr still battery running on Wifi And whatsapp. I am not heavy user. but still In office wifi is connected for 8 hrs this phone survived easily. Screen is vivd 295ppi.  camera is awesome, slow mo 720p is perfect. Phone is delicate i dont know why but I cant Put my phone even in Pocket :P now buttons for volue lock key are decent. Now the call quality thing: you have to set the volume to 50% or anyone can listen to your call. Wifi Signal catching is in good range. Dual speakers are same if you set on high volume sound will crack but set it on 80% I have used only for 24hr I will update after every one week month and six onths just to help some of my fellas out there who are reading and get confused about what to buy in budget range cause budget is big thing for us. 5 stars fpr phone display,camera. Used this phone for more more than 10 days it is working well pictures are clear. battery back up is for more than one day for me( wifi 24 hr even in office and home+low brightness whole time). head phones are cheap quality but why the charger and headphones are white? I dont understand the concept. I already have the skullcandy headphones working well with this device. I will update after one month. Till now the best of the best! Used it for months now I have started using more more brightness and high end gaming with graphics. All is set for 12 hours ( full time wifi on and 40% screen brightness ) phone is bit slow while switching to apps while playing games. Battery is kind of drawback but screen resolution pics are amazing. Will update after month.",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

I ordered for a replacement and got it within 1 day. The new one did not seem to have any problems. But the screen turned yellow and the buttons went inside the body.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,1 star,order cancelled without information,"Hi Team, This was the worst experience ever i have had with filpkart, I had processed an order on 23rd Dec for a phone MotoG2, on exchange offer through my mobile application from standard chartered credit card, Order no:-OD201618115386931100. I processed this order when i was traveling i ordered this phone for my uncle & by mistake i had but his incomplete mobile number 09890581865, i forgot the last digit 5 to enter while placing the order, Now the delivery was expected by the 1st Jan, Now today when i checked my email i got a mail from flipkart that my order was cancelled without me being aware of it & i spoke to Pranay, Sunil Alok & everyone easily hung up the phone on me. Sunil being a manager hung up that was strange.  They said they couldn't help & i will have to replace the fresh order & the same offer is no longer available.  Now as a customer try and understand how i would feel agreed that the mobile number was incorrect but the email ID was correct an email could have been sent that ""please contact us in 48hrs or 72hrs since we are not able to get in touch with you due to your incorrect mobile number & i you don't contact your order will be cancelled"". Rather than directly cancelling my order.  Now my request was to help me place the same order again as a human error of typing can always be there & i as a customer had already made the payment & had never asked for the order to be cancelled.  Hope somebody considers this mistake & helps me because as of now my perception is Flipkart does not requires customers and thinks only they sell mobile phones.

Battery life of ~20 hrs with calls of 30-45 min, wi-fi on 10 hrs, rest on 3G, social media usage, email checking & game playing of maybe 20 min Useful apps out of the box  Minuses Camera for indoor/low light photos Screen shows blotchy reds and faded blues GPS first fix takes a very long time ~6-8 min (a big minus for me) Charging time is high at ~4 hrs.   But at this price, I'd buy it again, not the brilliant Zenfone 5, which is as good/better in some areas, except 2 - I found Moto G a bit easier to hold and use singlehandedly, the battery life is better than Asus, with the better screen being Asus USP over Moto G.   Now about FK. I was a bit disappointed to wait for 8 days for delivery, as the status messages showed the phone was stuck in transit for the most part. To be fair, FK did say 10-12 days at the time of the order, however I suppose I've gotton used to FK's superfast delivery.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,4 stars,Awesome Product.. Worth buying it,"Hello readers,  I, here first time writing review of any product. For moto g 2nd i would definitely suggest to buy it. Really it is product of value for money. After using 20 days. I am writing pros and cons of this product. Pros: 1) Great display you would love it at this price. 2) Multitasking much easier. 3) picture quality of camera is good front(2mp) as well back(8mp). 4) sound quality of call is great. 5) Built in quality and Hardware is great. Cons: 1) Battery backup is real issue like any smart phone,, It can allow you to run 24 hours backup for medium user for heavy user battery die in 12 hours max. and in case of wifi user it will give poor battery performance. 2) some times difficult to judge which one is upside and downside as both side looks same. 3) Hands free given with the phone is not up to the mark.  So, overall i rate this device definitely pick. At this price range it is difficult to find such great device in market. I hope you like my review.

How many times do we get out product replaced and take back-ups and transfer our data. Very very disappointed with the call quality.

There's no lag(even while loading heavy games like FIFA 15 or Ashphalt 8) and all my apps run smoothly. The battery life is great and lasts upto a day on heavy usage.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,Great phone at even better price,"I switched from windows phone (lumia 820). Obviously there are many nice things to like here. Android OS, customizability, ROMs and what not.  I heard good things about moto series and am not at all disappointed by the device. The construction is of good quality not unlike the Nokia phones. Device is appropriately thin and light but it's not setting records in either category. At 13k, it's probably not meant to.  Coming to the performance, I am pleasantly surprised at how far android has come since I left it (2.2 froyo) in search of smoother experience (hence the WP). It's not that the device doesn't stutters. It does. But they are not in general animations and transitions. Maybe if I am running too many apps and want to switch from google play to camera. It's only 1GB after all.  Otherwise, the feeling of stock android is pretty great and if used well, this phone keeps things smooth. And this is someone coming from WP which is a damn smooth system even on lowly 530. So I know what actually good performance feels like (820 is not the fastest phone out there but it's no slouch either).  Moreover, the upcoming Lollipop update should help sweeten the deal even further. I plan on unlocking the bootloader soon and getting into flashing roms. Just waiting for at least one OTA to make its way onto a pristine system.  I dont' use the camera much. I think it'll do well in good lighting conditions but I don't expect too many low light shots to shine through. That's all from a couple of shots I did take just to check out the app.  Overall, I am very happy with my purchase and can easily recommend this phone.",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Cons: * Battery Backup is not good(Requires 2 to 3 recharges a day if connected to 3G/2G all day plus games for 1 hr and browsing 30mins and location sevices for 1 hour) and battery one percentage drops every 10 to 15 mins, * Motorola should atleast give 3200mAh Battery for all the Moto E,G,X series. * Front cam is not impressive if you take a lot of selfies. And Camera app is Buggy. * Very low quality headsets(Worth just 50rs/- or maximum 100rs/-. Bought skullcandy and its great. so another extra 500 bucks you may have to spend if you are a serious music junkie like me). * Charger is overheating while charging but the phone stays cool(No probs for me). * Price a little Higher(2000 may be) considering the processor and graphics card and chipset same as MOTO E. * Almost doubled the price of MOTO E for just camera and bigger display?

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,1 star,Dont Buy this product. - Worst Customer Service,"As like everyone, I also impressed by the feature of the Moto G 2nd gen. I got it right on the 1st week of launch. It was quite good until the day happens.   After the 60days of using the mobile, I got an issue, it happened suddenly, it turned off automatically, I charged it for an hour and tried to turn it on. It just kept showing the moto logo and no further response, I did all the basic troubleshooting from my side. I am even ready to do the factory reset. No use, it just kept displaying the logo. I reached out the service center on 14th Dec, they are not ready to do the basic trouble shoot, they just got the mobile and gave me some work out Num. and told the mobile will be ready in 7 days.  I called the service center again in 3 days, to know the status. They told like they are waiting for Parts to come from moto. I gone weird, on further questions they told like the 'Mother Board gone busted' and they have requested for the replacement of mother board to moto, and they are waiting for the parts to arrive.    1 - How come a 60days mobile get trouble with Mother Board.  2 - How come the service persons request for replacement of mother board, without my permission.  Customer Service, the another Hell which i entered into. Worst ever Customer Care service.    - They told there is no replacement after 30 days, even if the mother board is got busted  - One of the service person said, his moto g also got busted and questioning myself what can we do.  - They agree that Moto g 2nd is facing the mother board issue for many customers.  - NO ONE is ready to talk about the replacement.   In due after 7 days I called to check whether they at least replaced the parts Another shocking from the service center, they told as it was moto g2nd they may another 4 days to dispatch the parts from moto side.   Again I reached Moto Customer Service, A lady picked and told that she has escalated the issue and will be getting call in 24 hrs.  - No response in 24 hrs, when I reached the moto again, they told there is no such a escalation at all.   - am being fooled by the service persons again and again.   - One guy said, i must call at the where Service Center is open and they will have the conference call to give the solution, ( i dont why they cant do in offline without me)  Now, they agreed to give me a solution in another 48 hrs, that is too over, i didnt get back any calls yet   The SLA of the issue is 7 days, but even after 12 days, they are not ready to give a compormising response    - I will still going to reach out them.   - Mother Board getting busted in 60days is not at all a good mobile  - Motorola is not ready to replace the device as it was more than 30 days, another irritating service  - No one ready to give you any proper response or ready to take responsible for our escalation.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,3 stars,Value for money but quality & after sales still questionable,"I'd purchased Moto G (2nd gen) from flipkart on 3rd October 2014. Fairly quick delivery. Impressedwith the product.  But then on 20th december 2014 (that is less thn 3 months from date of purchase), my device would just not turn on. Online chat support was fairly impressive but not really helpful.   There are VERY FEW privately owned authorised service centres for motorola. Here's my story:  When i finally reached the service centre (in thane, Mumbai), I was informed that I had to wait for at least 90 minutes before my problem would be heard. THE AUTHORISED SERVICE CENTRE ALSO ACCEPTS XAIOMI, BLACKBERRY, HTC and one more brand i cannot recollect. And for all of these, it has just 1 counter. I came to know of a BB customer who waited for over 3 hours for his turn.  Finally when it was my turn, this was what was told to me:  ANY SOFTWARE PROBLEM WILL TAKE MINIMUM 3 DAYS, AND ANY HARDWARE PROBLEM WILL TAKE ATLEAST 10-15 DAYS. This was a standardized statement for all customers.  Bottom-line- You CANNOT expect quick, easily or accessible after sales service. Even though I have been a motorola fan, I'm beginning to question its reliability after listening to so many experiences and experiencing trouble myself.",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,3 stars,gamer review after 3 month usage,"willn't talk about specs but below are some points to consider before u buy it 1 - good mobile if you are an office guy..good UI exp. as stock android is there. 2 - not worth for hardcore gamers why.?? coz high games like asphalt, have to be played at low resol otherwise even with medium graphics it crashes out, same with other games. 3 - battery is an issue if you play asphalt contentiously it will last to 3-3.5 hrs..i have used other mobiles at 10k segments & they last for 5 hrs below is the battery life while using cont, having battery saving on & with battery doctor : high game like asphalt - 3-3.5 hr, temple run -5 hrs,camera - 4 hr, music - around 4.5 hr, wifi - 4-4.5 hrs,  currently i play temple run for 1 hr in a day, 1 hr on call with 2g check whatsapp, gmail & fb check after half an hour each just for 5 min & having dual sim inserted & i get battery backup of around 5 - 5.5 hr  4 - sound (music) is loud but not enough clear still acceptable 5 - good grip, easy to use & good look 6 - some heating prob while using camera & gaming 7 - camera is 8 mp but is awesome. it looks better than 13 mp in it's segment, proper & clear image but only in day light. at night it is like 5 mp in it's segment. front camera is good 8 - take much time to get charged, more than 3 hr from 0 to 100%  final words it is a better option if you are not an hard core gamer even after that you have to charge it twice a day.best for an office guy.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,Pure Andriod Experience - Best in its class,"I will directly write the pro's n cons of this device so that its easily helpful for all. I am writing this review after using it for more than 2.5 months (83 days to be exact).  Pros: 1.Camera: a)Front Camera-This is the best thing about this phone.The 8 m.p camera works better than 12 m.p camera of other Indian brands like Micromax etc. The HDR mode is best for snaps.  Personal Suggestion- Download and Use Google camera app instead of inbuilt camera app. As Google camera app supports various modes for camera like Photo sphere, Paranoma, Lens blur and better HDR mode.  Front camera- 2 m.p.It is also good for taking selfies. Believe me images come pretty good more than expected.  2.Display- A 5 inch display. it depends on person to person . I like 5 inch display rather than 4.5 inch diplay on old Moto g. The diplay is bright and good. And come on friends who notices ppi with naked eye.  3. Dual Stereo Speakers- Good for watching movies and playing games and are loud enough. And as both speakers are on front side so u don't need to worry about placing phone upside down n all on table or bed so that speakers don't get blocked.  4. Software- Pure Android experience and getting updates time to time #Lollipop coming soon. After Nexus devices Motorola is the 2nd company to get updates.  Note- Don't think that after Lenevo- Motorola Deal there will be any effect on updates. Google has sold only hardware unit and not all the patents n all. And even Nexus 6 hardware is by Motorola.  5. Price- At least if i compare it with brands like Samsung's, LG, Nokia,etc it is best value foe money phone.  Cons:  1. Less Ram 1 GB- Lags some time and apps crash sometime.(1.5 GB or 2 GB ram would be sufficient ).  2. Design- Dust may enter through gap between the Dual Stereo Speakers and most people don't like than design and want their phone to be fully flat and covered on front.  3.Feels bulky and bigger in hands when compared to other slim 5 inch phones.  Now regarding Battery backup I can't place it neither as a pro nor as a con. It is neither best nor bad. It is better than other phones in range and average user may sometimes get more than a day.  Note- File manager and audio recorder etc are not available. But it is not an issue you can download from play store for free .  Last But not least- Flipkart Service at its best as always. Thanks. Merry Christmas",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,Good Mobile,"Camera : 8 MP main cam & 2 MP front. Very good snaps so far both indoors and outdoors. 2MP - great selfie.Cam clarity is Excellent Sound : The front dual speakers are awesome. Very nice sound.Sound experience is superb. Phone gets headed.Heats very rarely in normal use Pure Android (4.4.4) (ALSO GUARANTEED UPGRADE TO ANDROID LOLLIPOP 5.0) No File Manager installed (You need to download ES File Explorer from Play Store) Go to Settings>>About Phone and tap 5 times on Build number to enable developer mode. 2) PROCESSOR: Moto G Runs on 1.2 GHZ SnapDragon ARM based Processor, On the other hand ASUS runs on 1.6 GHZ Intel x86 based processor. The point here is most of the (99%)android apps are designed to run on an ARM based cpu. Expandable memory - Additional advantage Moto G(1st gen) with the screen size of 4.5 inch had 2070 mah, which was the one of the drawbacks of the phone. Atleast now they should have used 2500 mah battery for the 5inch new moto G(2nd gen) , but they have used the same 2070 mah battery. Performance is also very good Well Design and accurate Delivery by flip kart Headphone sound was average.HD Recording is good and camera is effective on dark room (no light) at 3.5 meter only and picture is good on Mobile flash light.Headphone wired is not too good.File Manager not found on 4.4.4 kitkat  Battery(2070mh) performance is good if it is mixed use. 22hrs guaranty.brilliant 5 inch IPS display which produce very high quality images and vides with 720P.  1.2 GHz Qualcomm Processor which allows you for multitasking.",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,1 star,Motorola Support - Do you exist?,"Hi,  I had purchased Moto G, 2nd Gen from Flipkart on 06th of September, 2014. Flipkart was quick as usual in delivering the product at my door step. The device worked well for 3 months until 14.12 when it started refusing to boot-up. Took the phone to the Motorola authorized support expert where the device was detected with motherboard problem. On 16.12, I had filed a formal complaint with Motorola (via email) for which I received an email back from Motorola saying ""Your question has been received. You should expect a response from us within 24 hours."". Today, it is 23.12. Haven't heard from them yet, despite several reminders in between.   When I bought this phone, a lot of my friends suggested not to go with Motorola. I am realizing that they were right. Do they have any service/support at-all? Or only sales? Do they realize that somebody is suffering because of their disgusting product and service.  At the moment, it is not going anywhere. Anybody faced similar problem? Any way out?",,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,4 stars,A decent product,"I was using a Sony Xperia U running CM11 which fell and broke. So after a lot of research, I bought the Moto G 2nd Gen for 11.7k.  Build Quality - 8/10 ( The volume and power buttons are flimsy )  Looks - 10/10 ( Surely the best looking phone at this price range )  Display - 7/10 (Display is sharp and bright, still can't match up to Sony's)  Sound - 10/10 (Might sound funny, but the speakers are loud enough to put my laptop's onboard speakers to shame)  Call quality - 7/10 ( Maybe BSNL to blame, but call quality is not up to my expectations)  UI - 9/10 (Vanilla Android)  Camera - 7/10 ( The default camera app needs improvement. Google camera gives superb results)  Battery - 6/10 (Battery back up is good, but I'd rather have a higher capacity battery)  I opted for this phone over Zenphone 5 because of stock android. Zenphone has a nice UI, but it becomes a burden after a few months. With stock android you have the option to customize it your own way.

Especially when you open a relatively big app and close, you will see that launcher crashes.  CPU speed. Yes, this is a budget phone but I found Redmi 1S is way faster than this phone. The phone does lag. Dont believe anyone who says it doesnt. I have used a higher end phone also and this is slow and it shows. But, not very slow.  On a whole, its a very decent phone.

Shame on You!!!!","I bought this phone a while ago, and everything worked well until one day when the phone completely drained of charge and when i tried to switch it on after charging, it went on a Boot Loop.  I then handed over this phone to the Motorola Service Centre in Bhubaneswar (that also happens to be the service centre of Karbonn, Micromax, Alcatel etc) on 28th November,2014. They by the way are the most dumb people I have ever come across, I find government officials to be more responsible then these servicing people. I am still waiting to get my phone repaired/replaced.  I went to the customer service center at least 10 times without any success. The worst part is that I called Motorola on their toll free no. and explained the issue, and they are saying the Parts for this phone are not available in India! And they seem to have escalated the issue and told me I would get a call from the ""Actual Service Officials"" within the next 24 hours. But they 24 hours wait has now turned into 240 Hours wait.  I would strongly suggest users not to buy this phone. Only good specifications doesn't buy you a Customer Motorola, effective after sales service is also important.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,THE BEST MID-RANGE PHONE,"I bought this phone when it launched, and I am posting this review after using it extensively.  It is the best mid range phone having excellent features. It has a 8MP primary camera and 2MP secondary camera which is far better, when compared with its predecessor.  My views  Pros:- *The battery life, which is the most important aspect is pretty good. *Better gaming experiences than the old version due to larger display. *The phone does not hang at all as against the other Low Cost phones which have flooded the market. *The photo quality is excellent. *The flash works amazingly during low light. *I have seen people losing their cool, as half of a mobile's feature is nullified because of low internal memory. This mobile obviously doesn't give you a reason to crib on those grounds.   Cons;- *The sound quality could have been better. *The phone could have been slimmer. *SAR value seems to be a big deterrent.When compared with Samsung devices the figures seems to high. *Moto should work on reducing the SAR value when they plan the next version.  The phone is good, and that is the reason everyone is talking about it.",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,Best Budget smartphone,"Moto G2 ! A great piece at affordable price. I got a faulty piece for first but was easily replaced by flipkart. Thank you for the service. The camera quality is great front facing is also not bad, works excellent in day light. The ram should have been 1.5GB for more smooth multitasking,but looking at the price you cant really complaint. 16GB memory brings everything in your hand and this one has a OTG(On The Go) support too. As said by the moto they will be providing 5.0 update to this device as early as possible. Interface is almost pure android. Though it has a gorilla glass 3 i have noticed some scratches on the screen so please ensure that you put on a screen guard as early as possible. The stereo speakers are lound but sound cracks sometimes mostly when you play a song with heavy bass. The battery life is average about 7-8 hours of moderate usage and about 4-5 hours of heavy usage.(If the connection is 3G) Overall a very good phone by moto and in budget.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,1 star,Unbelievably Pathetic!!!,"I had bought this phone as a gift. I had done plenty of research before buying this phone and everywhere this phone has got praises. Except for very few low rated reviews on flipkart. Unfortunately, I ignored these reviews thinking they were one-off cases and ordered the phone. Now, the 1st phone I got; 3G wasn't working and there was a buzzing sound coming from the earpiece during calls. I got it replaced.  The 2nd phone had the same buzzing sound problem, but this time it was LOUD. So I got curious as how can 2 random phones could have the same defect. So I checked my friends' phones (around 3-4 moto g 2s) ALL HAD THE SAME PROBLEM! Just that the buzzing was very faint, but when I pointed it out, everyone could predominantly hear the buzzing sound. I requested for a replacement.  The 3rd phone had the same problem, however the buzzing was very faint. Also, now the main speakers sound warped when I play songs with a lot of treble.  I believe the people who complained about the speaker now. It is present in all the phones. I cannot believe that motorola is selling such crap now that they have established a decent enough market share in India.   N many thanks to flipkart for giving me 3 replacements, just unfortunate that the product itself is a fail.",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase
Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,3 stars,A good mobile device.,"Google, through Motorola, got a decent upgrade through this 2nd Generation Moto G. I also purchased MOTO G Ist Gen for 13999 and I now feel really having been duped into buying that 1st Gen crap. When devices like Mi3 got into our hands for same price as MOTO G 1st, it was a huge letdown for those who purchased 1st Gen, MotoG. That said, this is a decent device with middle ranking specifications and a camera that's just ok for casual photography. Nothing to boast about. The screen size is a good advancement over the previous iteration. But even at 12999, this is, in my opinion, a tad on the higher side of pricing. Now that we have Redmi1s & Mi3 as price reference, I believe that this a highly overpriced gadget. Presently we have many options in this price range where we can get better phones at lesser price points. If one can live with ""late"" updates, Huawei Honor at 6999 is a better option.",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,4 stars,Moto G - White After few days of Use,"Shopping Experience: I tried placing the order atleast 7 times before finally placing it. 2 times it went out of stock, and even after placing my email for a notification of availability, i didnt get any email. While placing the order, the offers kept changing every second, and finally the product went out of stock ! Finally, I had to place my order like i was catching a Shatabdi  Delivery of Product :  I ordered the product and was given an estimate of Dec 16 for delivery. I received it on Dec 12. 5 stars for delivery and package quality.  The Product itself: I had checked the technical configuration and found it to be pretty good at this price range.  saw useful comparisons with LG 90, but looking at the number of pieces sold, i went for Moto G. The appearance of the phone is very classy, the white color gleams out. Battery backup is pretty good with average calls, gaming and net surfing. I believe it could last more than 2 days if not fiddled much. I did experience some heating while playing Gunship battle around the camera lens. The Andriod version takes some time to get used to after you have used a Samsung. Camera quality is quite good, I did see some concerns for the Moto E camera, but now im fine. The size is as large as Nexus and takes a day to get acquainted to after you've used a 4 inch screen.  If you have the above 10 budget, you can go for it.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,1 star,Pathetic Service of MOTO G,"I purchased this product one month back and the phone was working alright for few days. After few days the phone experienced some problem with not getting switched so i took to their authorized service dealers in pune. The experience has been horrendous since then, their service centers are shared by many multi brands and they have highly non-professionals at their service center. They committed that they will give an estimate and solution to the problem within 2 days but there hasn't been any communication after 2 days so i spoke to their service center and they claimed they will take another 7 days to give me an estimate and when i insisted that i need it urgently they replied in an irritating manner to contact motorola. The customer care of mototrola also is not equipped enough with info and they hung me up for around 30 mins to finally escalate the matter further. The matter will take another 2 days and till then i am clueless what this company is doing for its customer. The service level is below pathetic than any brand in todays market and i fail to understand how can a mobile take 7 days to identify the problem.  Motorola is not recommended for its after service after the experince that i have went through and i was planning to buy for my mom but now i wont even recommend at all for their service standard. I request flipkart and its users to discontinue using moto phones till they resolve their service standards.  Pathetic! Disgusting!

I contacted airtel but there has been no response from them. I have wasted so much time and money while moving here and there from flipkart and airtel and so on.  At least flipkart can ensure if the offer by Airtel in genuine or not. Either this is mis-selling attempt by Flipkart for selling their phone or they have send me the second hand phone where the airtel might have disconnected the offer after giving one.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,4 stars,Okay for the price,I received a defective piece on delivery. The ringtones and sms tones were not ringing when notifications were received. On exchange I got a working model the 2nd time only when I realized that the first one delivered by flipkart was probably a used one because it had a clear screen guard already on it which I thought was the usual protective one received from the manufacturer. But the new one's screen protector had specs printed all over it. I am pretty sure the first one delivered was a returned item (probably from someone who had found the same ringtone issues and returned) which gives me a bad feeling about Flipkart that they are trying to shove the defective pieces again onto other buyers thinking that someone would at least quietly keep them !

On monday I waited the whole day and tried to call at the given number to confirm if the delivery will be done, but there was no response and neither the courier boy contacted, I left office late expecting for a call back but all in vein. To my shock I receive a message at night that the since the delivery was attempted twice and couldnt be completed hence the order stands cancelled. when was the 2nd attempt made, can I get an explanation of it????? I wanted this to gift to someone and I am a regular shopper from Flipkart, and after this incident I will have to think before making any purchase from this site.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,Best budget phone under 14k (this is a user experience review),"I ordered from fast delivery and dam it was fast than i expected.The packaging was good. WS retailer is the best seller on Flipkart by far.  The Moto G2 is the probably the best the best smart phone in this price range. It function good and its very smooth in use. Also the lolipop update are rolling out soon for Moto G2. 16 GB inbuilt and expandable memory upto 32 GB is the best feature all the phone should have. The 8 mp camera does the job very well and also you can download Google Camera for more features (if you are into photography and stuff). the front firing speakers are awesome and are very loud and clear (you will enjoy watching movies). The 5 inch HD display works good in broad day light (sunlight). The company claim that the phone is water resistant though I have not tested it (never will). Other features such as Motorola Migrate, Motorola Alert, Motorola Assist just make your contacts, photo,video...etc transfer easily and fast (once you figure out its easy). I would recommend you to go for it.",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Today the 1st button to on or off the mobile / wake it from the sleep mode is not working. I was directed by flipkart to one of the third party service agency for repair . I am not sure about the authenticity of the service provider. Flipkart is not providing the Motorola email id / phone number. Beware before you purchase any motorola mobile   I submitted the device for motherboard change on 24-12-2014 to the authorised service provider as per their advise. The service provider said that that it will take a week to get the mother board, I am speaking to Motorola and the service person for the past 20 days and nothing is happening. There are conflicting versions from Motorola and the service provider regarding the service. I received a message from Motorola that the device has been repaired. But to my surprise, the service provider is saying that the mother board is yet to be received by them and it will take more time. When I spoke to motorola, they are not at all helpful. As on date i,e. 13-01-2015, I am yet to get the mobile back from the service provider. As such I request all the potential purchasers to think before placing any order on motorola mobile as the Motorola products are substandard and useless.",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,1 star,Buy this Phone at your own risk. Highly Disappointed.,"Im sure you are buying this phone as you think that its an affordable Android with amazing features. Please read this review before you take the plunge  I have received two Moto G (Second Gen) from Flipkart. BOTH WERE DEFECTIVE.  First piece delivered on 5th December . Started switching off automatically and then restarting from 7th December. Tried Factory Reset but it was of no use. Placed a replace order. Got a new piece on 15 December. I must say Flipkart is very efficient and prompt in customer care. I checked the box as soon as I got the package and it was not tampered. Tried to insert the SIM card and it was not popping in (SIM card is fine. Tried it on other phones).   So remember when you are buying this phone there is a very very good chance that you may receive not one but two faulty phones in a row. Still want to purchase this Phone ? Good Luck to you!!

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,1 star,Not a reliable product(atleast for me)Poor after sale service by Motorola.,"""Background""  I ordered the set on (6th sept 2014) and got it delivered on (17th sept) after certain delays in shipping it.  ""The brighter side"" No doubt the product has marvellous features- a good cam, display-sound quality,touch andall that at a price of 13k. Its your perfect buddy for running apps and being updated....TILL IT STOPS TO FUNCTION !!  THE DARKER TRUTH.. AND CONTINUING FRUSTRATION I AM STILL FACING:  My set stopped working on 5th dec (IN JUST 3MONTHS!!)it was not even switching on only motorola android was getting displayed with a lot of anger and frustration and still with a hope to get it right at moto service centrei wentther next day itself, i explained them the problem and they asked to submit my set after having the invoice to replace a part which was a manufacturing defect. Its been like 8-10 days and they still havent got the parts(thats what they say) and have given me only a receipt of their shop with no signatures and asked to wait for another couple of weeks .They have not even given another set for use for the time being.This case has happened with many more and i think if in a city like Mumbai they are not able to transport the parts for their valued customer (as they say while selling) then may god help those buying moto products from smaller cities. *No criticism for product features but durability and customer satisfaction ke mamle me its not a company to rely on"" #personal experience",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Pros: Good Speed for browsing, Multi Tasking is excellent, Main Camera is good, Front camera is not bad, it has good speakers. I haven't played any games with the device so i can't comment on that subject. Life and durability is yet to be determined.  Cons: Battery is charging slowly and it drains quickly. I am not surprised by this, as this is the case with most of the smart phones. Data Cable is not available with the mobile, even though plenty of micro usb cables are available in the market, Moto should have provided the data cable.   After Installing Battery saving apps (Battery Doctor) now the Battery life is good. Overall its a good phone at this price.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,4 stars,Decent Phone. On time delivery,"Some comments not mentioned in the earlier reviews. Phone is fantastic, butter smooth and pleasing to use.  1. Thought that google contacts will automatically sync after signing in and using Migrate but did not happen. Had to transfer the vcf file from my Samsung to get all my contacts. SIM card contacts of course did sync. 2. Cannot force the phone to use 3G. I use a DOCOMO connection and it changes from E to H and H+ randomly. Could be a problem of Docomo. 3. Started the day with full battery at 6:30 AM and by 8:15 , of constant listening to music and using 2G + 3G the battery reached 76%. So I am not sure if the battery will last the day. Charged the phone for 8 hours by the way. 4. Using Samsung earphones , the audio seems good. The provided headphones don't look or feel good. 5.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,Great value for money,"It has been 20 days since i got this device from Flipkart. To start with, I had my own concerns after going through the reviews. But then finally made up my mind to go for it. And I don't regret it one bit. Below are the pros and cons i observed in these 20 days of usage. PROS: 1. Both front and back camera are just fine. Pics come out pretty decent. Obviously u can't expect DSLR quality in this price range. 2. 1 GB RAM is more than enough to run all the apps and games smoothly on this device and the quad core processor is pretty good with no lags so far. 3. Front speakers are great. Sound cracks a little at high volume but that''s not a major issue at all. 4. Smooth touch and awesome looks.  CONS: So far, the only issue i have faced is the battery back up. Its not really good, but then you can always carry a power bank along with you.   In the end, I would just say, it's a good product from MOTO and definitely a great value for money.",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Moto G 2nd Gen filled in the space between Mata G 1st Gen and Moto X quite well. I found it to be good enough for using as compared to some high end phones by Samsung and other brands.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,Awesome Phone against money,"Awesome Phone against money spent.  - Greate camera - Sound Quality is good ( headeset is poor quality, but if you get new one from market or use existing good one, will get good quality of sound ) - Touch is great. - Phone Speed and processing is awesome, I played lots of games and downloaded ashplat and many big 3d games, played many times, no hang or no heating issue. - Battery life is decent, over wifi works full day (24 Hrs) and in 2g - 3g works works around 14 - 15 hrs  - One of the major thing which is not written or i didn't get in specification is it supports OTG. Which is quite surprise for me after buying :-), I tested with my micromax tab keyboard, kingston and sandisk pendrive - data trasfer is greate and supports major items. - Its also come with latest android.  Go for moro g second gen if you have this budget, don't go behind any other brand like samsung, lg or panasonic.  I also have Nokia 620, it also good on same price if you like windows. Many user doen't like this but if you want stable product and better battery, go for windows.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,"Good enough for the Budget, Satisfied.","First of all quick delivery by flipkart. Got it on second day of order at Kerala. Delivery man came to my office, he called me 5 times as i was not there, i was unable to attend, he left me a message. When i called him back, he came again to my office to deliver it. Usually courier people call us on phone and ask us to collect shipment from their office.   About Phone: My budget was 20k . Searched on internet for months and finally decided about Moto g2. Phone looks stunning. It is easy to handle as it is curve shaped. Display and Camera are good for the budget. Stereo speakers are awesome. Battery was the biggest issue for which i didnt buy it earlier.. But after using 3 days, i m satisfied with it. Battary lasted upto 11pm since mornig for last 2 days for moderate using. And USB OTG function is working fine, we could transfer data @ 15mbps from a usb pendrive.  Who should go for it? If your budget is near 15 (20 if u want OTG on phone), u want a 5 inch phone that is easy to handle and looks good, go for it. But if u want to use net throughout day, go for any other phone, or buy one power bank also with moto g.",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Day 3 started my struggle with the phone getting constantly getting hung up and getting over heated. called the customer service exe who told me that its normal for the phone to get heated up and that i should not complain about it. i was very much upset about the product and now the customer service was even more hurtful. eventually i requested for a replacement reaching the limit of my patience and i get a call back saying that hanging is a natural thing and that i should restore my phone to factory setting and that it would solve my problem. and that said we will call u back to check if the trouble shoot has worked or not which they never did. and went ahead and closed my request saying that we cant take a return request as we solved your problem. how does this even sound logical? than a few days later i call up again to place a replacement request this time they say that they are replacing the phone as they accept its faulty. and said that the phone will reach me on 8th. i was keeping a track of it on their website and i was waiting for my phone the last i checked it said that the product was dispatched from bangalore. and is expected in Hyderabad. and the very next day it said return request is canceled. i was shocked and called up the customer care and they said it was canceled due to logistical problems. and they said they were placing a request immediately and that the product will be delivered today. i called in specifically to ask if it can be deliver on today as i was out of station but i got a call yesterday saying i need to come collect the product some 4-5 kms away from my delivery point. i told him that i am not in the city and asked him to come today for which he responded very rudely I quote"" Main thumara Naukar nahu huun agar chaheyae to aa ke lena nahito return kardunga"" i was shocked and requested him to deliver it today. he finally agreed after repeated calling and said he will be delivering it by 11 am today. i haven't got call till now so i called up the customer care and expressed my disappointed she just disconnected my call and i was put through to the survey.   I can understand that u guys don't have the intent to help but this is retarded. lost hope on e-commerce. thanks to one company.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,Superb Phone Moto G 2nd Gen and Hats of FLIPKART!!,"Just bought it yesterday...and believe me its superb. This is my first Android phone so i m still exploring it. 5inch display (crystal clear, crisp and handy enough) Lag free so far Decent camera for both indoor and outdoor pictures, Low light pictures are really good Good sound quality Android version : 4.4.4 micro SD slot (Moto G1 was not having it) Fast browsing Multitasking and Smooth Gaming, thanks to Qualcomm Snapdragon processor Best phone under Rs 15000. It provides Moto Assist which is pre-loaded in the phone.  Some people wrote about heating issues but I did not find any issues regarding that.  The only con I found is that it requires too much time for charging and average battery life.  Flipkart Service is superb.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,3 stars,Excellent phone but requires care,"SO i purchased this phone about two months ago. This is indeed an excellent phone for the price. Can't think of any cons yet, except for one.  The screen cover broke rather easily. The drop was rather small (from table to ground). The lcd screen is intact but the glass on top of it broke quite easily and the repair costs about 7k. I'd suggest buyers opt in for a screen guard and a good casing to protect the phone from these kind of unexpected disasters.  Battery life is ok, it lasts about 8 hours with internet etc working and lollipop upgrade should improve upon that.  For the remaining part, the phone is excellent for its price. Hardly any noticeable bugs, and the touch is very smooth. This phone has given me the best experience so far, minus the crack that happened to come up rather easily. A sturdier build from motorola would have taken this a lot far certainly.",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,Awesome smartphone in Rs12999 price.,"Its my first product from flipkart and flipkart makes me happy because I got my phone on 2nd morning after ordering at night on 10th nov. Nice service by flipkart.  I am writing the review about moto g 2nd gen after using the phone about 1 month. Pros: 1. 8 mp primary and 2 mp secondary camera. Both the camera is capturing nice picture. Also, primary camera works good at night also because of flash light.  2. Front speakers are stereo which will make you feel good while playing games or listening song. Audio quality is very good even at full volume.  3. I can play heavy games like asphalt 8, call of duty, etc without any lagging.  4. Phone connectivity(Network, wifi, bluetooth) is also good. I never saw my network fluctuation as other user was mentioning that this phone has some network connectivity problem.  5. Battery runs for more than or approx 24 hours if you use normally. I always use my phone in this way: About 3 hours for listening song without headphone, playing game asphalt 8, contract killer for 1 and half hour, 2 hours of calling on 3g network, 1 hour whats app, 2 hours internet browsing (chrome). My phone is 24 hours connected to wifi. Using both sim, one is 3g and one is 2g. Facebook, whats app, gmail app, linked in services run for 24 hours in background.   Using my phone in this way runs for 24 hours which is pretty good for smartphone.  6. Gorilla glass is tough.So many time, I carried key with my smartphone (by mistake) but didn't got any scratch.  7. The design of phone is very good. Its good in hand and it will not slip from your hand because of the bacpanel design.  Cons:  1. Basically, i don't have any point. So, i can write only one thing that camera app can be improved more.",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

They have blasted a sensational news that they have 10 mobiles in queue for mother board change.They said that it will take 2 days for repair.  Let's assume how bad it is within 2 days 10 mobiles need mother board replacement.If hardware is not good then whats the point in using the latest Android software.I have used this mobile only 2 months.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,Just The BEST!!!,"I have been using this phone for last few months and its awsm. Moto phones are best in its price range, no other brand can stand in any comparison. Hardware is best, looks are slim and stunning, latest andriod updates guaranteed, no extra bloatwares, in built softwares are very useful and of fine qualities, battery backup is great, camera is way too stunning, front stereo speakers are the best in class and performance, never hangs, best optimization of memory and processor, screen and touch are mind blowing, you have the option of different colors replaceable back-covers (original moto brand) that suits ur style. The only con I found is the charger is of low power but u can have high power charger frm market and get rapid charging. So the bottom line .. its the best phone among the ones i used within 15k price bracket. I'm loving it.. js go fr it without thinking twice!",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,4 stars,Wonderful Android Phone under 15 K,"I was not confident to buy phones online and always went to a store to purchase phones fearing warranty and service issues. On facing multiple issues with my previous Lumia phone under 1 year and being denied warranty, really bad service from one of the well known retail outlet of Thane. I felt taking the risk of buying online was worth a try.   Research and Booking : Windows phone was a sure ""NO"" with my past Microsoft & dealer experience. I had vast choice when i stepped into deciding on which Andriod phone. Decided on a budget of 15 K and started searching. ASUS Zenphone 5 was cheaper and an option i was willing to try. Due to the larger size and lower sound quality zeroed into booking Moto G 2nd Gen.  Delivery and Packaging: Must admit Flipkart delivery much before ETA (5 days), delivered in 2 days. The Packaging was good and it was a fresh piece.   Phone Usage Review : Initial few days faced a bit of trouble due to switching from Windows to Android. In 2 days was able to adjust and the Android experience is very good, though graphically you may miss the windows interface. Very Good sound and call quality. Camera is decent. The phone build feels strong and solid, buttons are sturdy the rubber back also gives better grip. Battery life is also very good with approx of 4 hrs of con calls + whats app + 10 - 15 mins gaming + reading some stuff online the battery still had 40 % remaining. Would recommend this phone to any user looking for Android phone under 15 K.",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

I like the dual sim feature although I do not use it.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,4 stars,"Good phone,but asus zenfone 5 is better","This is my 1st review. I've been using this phone since 12th September.  after 2 and half months of usage,I can tell you everything about this phone First of all,I would like to thank WS retail for this product.  Now I wont talk here about specs(because you can read it in the product description).I WILL TELL YOU ABOUT THE ACTUAL PERFORMANCE.  Best things: 1.HD screen is classic.Delivers sharp image and texts  2.Stereo speakers are very nice.  3.Due to round edge,it is very easy to handle   4.Rear Camera is also nice.Some details get missed in photos ,but overall it's a nice camera.  5.Battery life is good(except while playing heavy games)  6.The Phone looks really smart :)  7.SD card support is appreciable.   Average things: 1.Front Camera is bad.(looks live 1.3 Mega pixels)  Worst things:1.Due to 1 GB of RAM,,the phone lags often while multi-tasking(1.2 GHz quad core is nice,but RAM should have been at-least 1.5 GB).I am a phone-lover( I have used Galaxy S4,my father's iPhone 5c, Nexus 5)and therefore, I can surely say that IT WILL BE A MAJOR ISSUE.,because RAM matters the most while multi-tasking.  Verdict:Overall it is a good phone,but at the same price,asus zenfone 5 (16 GB) is available,which has 2 GB RAM(and all the things exactly the same) will be a better buy.Don't think that I am saying this only looking at the specs.My room-mate has Zenphone 5,which has nearly EVERYTHING better than this(except Battery life).  So,if you want to buy this phone and will upgrade it next year,then there's no problem.But if you are planning to buy a phone that will last for atleast 2 years,then Believe me,go for Zenphone 5.",0 of 1 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

I did not try high end games. But Asphalt 8 airborne stopped working after playing first level.  Things that can be improved:  1. The battery is not so great. It lasts for 1 day with very minimal usage.   2. I have trouble with the dual sim settings. Sometimes the signal for secondary sim   goes down. It can only be restored by restarting the phone.  3. Some of the high end games like Asphalt 8 Airborne wont run. They will crash after sometime.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,Best mobile for this price,"The mobile is very sleek and fast enough to run any app or game. I have been using this mobile for 2 months and haven't faced any problem with it. Got android updated as soon as i connected to wifi. It accepts micro sims only so I had to cut my 2 sim cards before starting using them.  Camera and sound is not so good. I get 6 MP instead of 8 MP while using picture ratio of 16:9. Display screen is sharp but in sunlight it is not very bright. That maybe because I use auto brightness.  Battery life is average. Once fully charged, it lasts at least for a day while using internet and games. It takes at least 3 hours to get fully charged from fully discharged state.

Well, I somehow managed to order the 16gig in the after noon as soon as i saw it available on launch day, 6th feb and it was an awesome feeling..Fools are those who are scolding Flip and rating the product 1, coz they were thinking whether to order it or not while others grabbed it in first look.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,Micromax NITRO vs MOTO G... Go for MOTO G,"I ordered the phone on Fri i.e. 21/11 and recv it on 24/11. I have not used much to write the review.. but according to me this cell phone is AWSM.. I order micromax Nitro from Amazon it was also good. 1 issue happened in NITRO was when battery reached 50% within 2 hours the cell phone switches off. Rest everything was ok. It happened 2 times with me so i returned the phone and received the refund. Then i booked MOTO G. The touch is simply amazing, Built is also good.. It is not too heavy light then Nitro. i use cell phone for Whatsapp, FB, Call n sometimes SMS. I don't play games.. So i can use the phone for more than 24 hours in a single go without charging.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,1 star,Very Very Poor customer Support,"I bought Moto G (2nd) form flipkart website on 9 September, 2014. It started showing some touch related problems within 35 days from purchase and its touch stopped working completely on 25 Oct, 2014 without any external damage. I submitted my phone to Motorola Authorized Service Center in Dehradun, after keeping my phone for 3 weeks they told me that touch of my phone was working fine and it had some motherboard issue. After confronting them why it too so long to discover the problem they started making lame excuses and started blaming one another. Also, Service Center was located in very dingy and dark place and employees handling the customers were very unprofessional. As i had lost trust in the Engineers who were handling the phone I contacted the senior officials to provide some proper solution to my problem. They assured me to ship a new phone, but it has been week and a half and haven't heard from them regarding how and when it will be shipped. So please before buying this phone kindly remember their service center support is really bad (specially in Dehradun).

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,finally choose moto g 2,"telling the truth, I was about to cancel this order 2 hours before the delivery of my moto g 2. The reason is I was not able to decide between Moto G 2 and Asus Zenfone 5(16gb). Both phones are priced at exactly same amount that is 12999.  Talking about the facts, zenfone 5 packed with 1.6 GHz intel's dual core processor which actually can perform like 4 virtual cores when needed plus its 2 gb RAM, this combo performs better as compared to Moto G 2nd gen. But that doesn't mean Moto G 2 is way behind the performance of zenfone. Reason is Moto runs stock android which saves lot of memory providing you the best android experience. Moto can run almost all games zonfone can. Here are they key points which made me choose moto g 2nd gen over zenfone and I am 100% happy with my choice!  1. Battery backup way better than zenfone. Have been using it since some days and it lasts all day long thats what I needed. compered to zenfone it gives backup of hardly 6-7 hrs 2. Stock android means the best android experience 3.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,4 stars,Best Smartphone under 15k,"MOTO G 2nd Generation is bigger & better at the affordable pricing. It ha a decent design & looks, which doesn't give you a sucking plastic feel like others. Display is nice with decent viewing angle but could had been perfect with a full HD display. It's also a good performance wise because its a stock android device. It plays high graphic games like Asphalt 8 , Modern Combat 5 & Dead Trigger 2 smoothly courtesy its 1.2 GHz Qulacomm processor supported by 1 GB of RAM . It comes with 16 GB inbuilt for storage. This time u can expand the storage with external memory card up to 32 GB. It has a 8 MP rear camera which does a decent job & doesn't disappoint in low light with led flash light, front facing camera is of 2MP which will be sufficient for selfie lovers. Best about Moto devices is that it receive Android updates easily before other smartphones.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,3 stars,An amazing phone with a major set back...,"I am a complete Motorola fan right from the time it was a sole company to it becoming a Google brand and now Lenovo... I personally own the Moto G, Moto E and now the Moto G2 I own this pc of great update since almost 4 months now and I have already got it replaced 2 times with the third request already under process. There is genuinely no concern with this model, in fact it is an answer to lot of concerns faced by competing brand phones. The only reason I have had to keep getting replacement for it is the display screen.  On all three occasions, the display screen has had the same issue. And the issue is: the display screen, on the volume rocker side, is a bit raised above the main phone body due to which there is a thin gap which emits the illumination form the display from the side of the phone. This seems to be the concern with all the three pcs that I have had my hands on, making it look more like product batch issue.  Having all this said, Flipkart guys have been super understanding and of great technical assistance over this issue every-time. Really kudos to you guys. Not easy keeping up the standard to the ""T"", consistently.  Final verdict: Go for this product even if you have a super humongous budget and can go fancy buying an expensive phone. Because you cannot beat the futuristic approach, that Motorola had before it sold itself to Google, with any other brand. Just a word of caution, as soon as you receive this product check for the screen. If any concern, contact Flipkart immediately. I am sure they would be more than glad to assist you on the same.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,4 stars,"Best choice for the price, although a bit too big for my taste.","I don't need to describe the specs again as it is already given at Motorola's official page. I have previously used a lot of Android phones like the Xperia ZR, Xperia L, but nobody came close to my tried and true Moto Defy+. I guess that is why I went for the Moto G. Build quality is good and grip with the Flip cover is excellent although I would have liked if the screen was 4.7 inch instead of 5 inch because it was too big for my hands. The UI is fast and responsive with less to none bloatwares, although free RAM was a bit of a concern because only 300MB was usable. It would have been good if they had included 1.5GB of RAM at least. Also, no 1080p recording. That was also a serious bummer considering the Adreno 305 can play 1080p. My Defy+ plus was (is) a beast because it never gave up even when I tortured it again and again with heavy drops, water splashes, and the Gorilla Glass was tough as hell because I never used a screen protector on it.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,4 stars,value for money,"i got my moto g 7 days ago ... i think i am eligible for writing a review after hardcore usage for nearly a weak .. 1. pretty quick processing .. 2. camera quality is really impressive including front camera 3. display quality is fairly good . 4. front dual speakers serve the job , pretty descent sound quality.. 5. OTG USB Support  6. 16 gb internal memory + microSD card slot 7. good gaming experience ( played heavy games like blood and glory , dear trigger 2 , asphalt 8 without any problem)  cons: 1. i dont care much about RAM . though i find 1 gb is enough for me ...multitasking can be tricky on this phone .. 2. fair battery backup ,but have to charge every day ( 6 hours of display time with average use including 1 hour of gaming , 2 to 3 hours of net usage , half hour to one hour calltime etc)  3. if put on a cover , phone tends to get hwarm after heavy gaming or camera usage )  but not too hot , warm .    i have tried to give u a unbiased opinion , simply best in this price range . only xiaomi mi3 is a better phone than this in this price range .. so if u are hesitating to buy this phone .please dont .. u will be satisfied at the end of the day ..",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,1 star,DISAPPOINTING SERIVCE BY FLIPKART,This review is for all the prospective buyer of flipkart who is intended to buy any product from so called mega e-commerce retailer. I want to warn each and every one of you to abstained oneself from get cheated and feel betrayed. I want to share my horrible experience that I had recently WITH FLIPKART. Few days back I booked a moto G 2nd gen and paid extra for GUARANTEE one day delivery. I did not receive the product on the schedule date and when contacted with customer care they said it cannot be delivered on that day but it will take 2 more days. I was also promised for compensation by way of cash in my flipkart wallet within 48 hours. But this could not happen even after a week. Moreover to my surprise they said I have asked them to reschedule delivery and that is why this was not delivered to me that day. I cannot understand how mischievous one can be! How fraudulent one of the reputed online store can be! How unprofessional one could be. Alas! Even after this much of persuasion they don't consider it as their responsibility to respond to its customer.  Conclusion:- good product but worst service. I am giving rating one because I was not allowed to give zero rating,0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase
Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,4 stars,Overall good phone but has some cons (Reviewing after 1 week usage),"Overall its a good phone by Motorola, but it does have some cons like.. 1. Speakers- speakers sound quality is very bad  2. Call quality- The nokia feature phone has much better call quality as compared with this phone.  3. Charging time- When I received this phone, it had 0% battery, It took 4.5 hours to charge only 80% battery. And now it is taking 3 to 3.5 hours to charge 100%  Otherwise this phone works great, as it has stock android so there is no lag. And battery life is also good, for medium usage it can survive the whole day.  And now I m expecting Android Lollipop..!  So, overall Its a good phone at this price tag!!!",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase
Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,1 star,Quality Issues with Motorola,"I am facing issue with the earpiece sound quality, there is a continuous hissing sound while in a call. The display registers scroll gesture as touch, which is very annoying while browsing web. Also the buttons are not good and the power button feels like it may break. This is in contrast to another set that I ordered for my friend.  Another interesting point is that the default plastic sheet on the screen had no logos on my set while it had some Motorola inscriptions on the one my friend received. Looks like it was a refurbished product sent to me. It is appalling to see such bad quality control on Motorola's part and Flipkart / WS Retail on not pursuing better standards.  Have called Flipkart Customer Care and they have promised call back in 48 hours, let's see.  Update : Received replacement today. This one has issue with antenna and is not able to connect to network. Tried different SIM cards as well. I am more and more convinced that they are pushing products without quality checks or are selling refurbished products to meet the demands. This is really disappointing. So far Flipkart's service has been good, though not sure if they are taking due care in making sure that the faulty product or batch of products is identified and notified to Motorola, or they are simply recirculating the returned products.",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,4 stars,MOTO G 2nd Gen Review from a Lumia 820 User,Well I was using Lumia 820 (Windows Phone ) Since Jan 2013. I recently switched to Android through Moto G 2nd generation. To be honest my experience has not been bad but it is not great either.  Andorid has apps that are missing in windows phone. In terms of Hardware or the OS performance I still feel that Nokia & Windows OS are the Best.  Talking about MOTO G 2nd Gen.  1) Camera : 8 MP camera does a decent job. It is ofcourse not the best. But good for the price you pay 2) Processor: Well to be honest the 1.5 Ghz Snapdragon processor in Lumia 820 is far better than the Quadcore processor on this device.  3) RAM : you get just about 831 MB /1024 MB.  4) Phone does experience some lag occasionally.  5) You get a lot of accessories to choose for this phone.  For prospective buyers I would suggest you go for this phone if performance ec is not that Important.  My suggestion : Go for a good Windows Phone(1GB is more than enough) or a good Android device with atleasst 2GB RAM,0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

They've replaced it ,but given me used product which was in extremely bad condition there were so many scratches on the screen (screen guard) , phones looks so old and the back side was smelling like something burn inside, may be chips (due to heating issue). I've contacted them regarding this issue, they said to replace it again. I hope they'll not provide the used one.  @Flipkart : Guys !!! I'm really disappointed wit you.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,4 stars,The Perfect Gaming.. Best Budget phone but the speaker and battery issues...:(,I am using this Phone from last 2 months..the gadget is simply great for Gaming ..Asphalt 8 Airbone experiance is awesome ..very good graphics..some lags after heating..but that can be ignored..  Camera is not so good bad but not so good as well...does focus properly sometimes..but it's flash light is very effective and bright..good photographs in dark as well..  Processor is simply great..very smooth for operating...  but i personally facing the issue with its speaker..it's a loud enough but the voice clarity is so poor...even it gets heated for longer time calls ..sometimes you can not even hold phone near to your ears for longer calls.. you may need to use your headphones which are not so good..disappointment from motorola ...  But the best part is google updates they are so fast on this gadget..  As a Google supported stock android OS (4.4.4..will soon get the Lollipop update too..) their are some drawbacks like calls recording and FM recording is not available..no restart button available...and the UI is sooooo very boring...but you can use launchers availables in market...motorola should have done some modifications in OS...  But overall a very good phone from Motorola....  And most important part about Flipkart..a very good service guys ..purchased two Moto G 2nd generation so far..once replaced ..but now everything is fine...

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,The Best Smartphone at a Price Range of 13K,"I ordered the Phone on September 11, 2014 and got it delivered perfectly before time by September 14, 2014. Surprisingly, this was my first ever purchase from Flipkart.   I am writing a review about this Product after using it for more than two months now.   Talking about some of it's key features:  a. 1 GB RAM: Works great but may lag a little while too multitasking if you have loaded your phone with too many apps.  b. Dual Sim (GSM + GSM): I'm using it for two Sim Cards and is working brilliantly for me.  c. 1.2 Ghz Qualcomm Quad Core Processor: Well, yes. It is pretty fast. Quad Core Processor helps.  d. 5-inch HD Screen: The screen is brilliant. Big and sharp display.  e. Expandable Upto 32GB: This is like a treat. You have Internal Memory of 16 GB which you can utilize for all the apps that you want and still have ample free space to fit at least 2 seasons of FRIENDS in it to watch during your commute. And I am using a 32 GB Memory Card along with it, which gives a brilliant memory space for everything that you need in your phone.  f. Android v4.4.4 (KitKat) OS: Well, if you are thinking of buying this cell. then do it. Because the exclusive surprises that Moto may give you in the upcoming months won't be even funny. Lollipop Update coming soon before anyone else except Nexus 5.  g. 8 MP Primary Camera and 2 MP Secondary Camera: No issues and no complaints at all. Clean, clear and sharp images.   Battery: Yes, if your cell shuts down due to low battery, it will take some time to boot again. Because it needs to get charged to a minimum voltage before it can start. That can be pretty irritating during urgency. The cell takes a bit of time to get fully charged but it's all good.   Trust me, no other phone in the 15K category beats this phone & the only phones in the market which you will feel inferior to are Moto X (1st Gen), Moto X (2nd Gen) and Nexus 5 and now the obviously upcoming Nexus 6.   But before you move on, a look at the prices of these phones: Moto X (1st Gen): 18,000 (Expensive by 5K) Moto X (2nd Gen): 31,000 (around 18,000 may be) Nexus 5: 24,500 (11,500) Nexus 6: 44,000 (not in the same league)  So yeah, go ahead and buy it.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,4 stars,A Very Good phone for its price,"First of all blazing fast delivery by Flipkart. Ordered on Sunday and delivered by tuesday.  The phone works amazingly well and for the price has very decent specifications. The 1 GB Ram and Snapdragon processor pack a punch and with Multiple apps in operation, switching between them is very smooth. The display is also very good and Sunlight legibility is also quite decent. The stock Android 4.4 does away with all the useless stuff and Transferring my DATA from my previous Android using the Moto Migrate App was a breeze. Camera is also quite good and Pictures taken are quite clear and vivid. Call quality is also nice and the Battery lasted more than a day with Dual SIM usage and 3G network use with moderate use.  Only Con I found till now was the metallic bars at the top nd bottom of the phone. They are a tad uncomfortable when u happen to take a call in a busy street and stick ur phone into ur ears.  But on the whole thats a very minor discomfort and Motorola has lived up to its name. Don't think too much if u r on a budget. Go and order.",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,The Best product in mid-range ....... awesome product form Motorola & Google,"I bought this product a month ago. Till then I using and I like the product too much. Its performance is very impressive. Though its overall performance is good but it has some cons. Pros: 1) The design is awesome that fits your hand easily. 2) Screen is bright 3) Camera quality is good but not as much good to compare with samsung 5MP camera quality. 4) Sound quality is awesome 5) Performance is awesome, all application run smoothly, even HD movie runs without stopping. Maximum game runs smoothly. 6) Call quality is good with noise cancellation. 7) Touch quality is nice. Cons: 1) Battery backup is not so as I aspect, but all android phone eats more battery , so compared to other battery backup is normal. 2) Time require for charging is more. 3) Less option for camera and music modes. 4) This product comes with no external usb cable , you have to buy separately.  But with all the Pros and cons the product is awesome.I think Motorolla and Google makes the product so amazing.  Thanks for the Motorolla+Google product and also thanks flipkart for the service.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,"Excellent Value for Money Phone, Surprisingly Good!","Moto G Second Gen was my first budget Android phone. For past 4-5 years, I have been primarily using flagship phones only from Samsung or HTC most of the time. I am really fed up with their never changing and ever heavier getting custom UI solutions which get in the way of updates as well.  But when I tested one of my colleague's Moto G, Wow! A budget phone with this good feel in hand and extremely fast performance, it was almost unbelievable. This phone proves that the specifications hype is not worthy of all the price we pay for these Octa Core phones. Sure you get Octa Core processor and 2 GB RAM, but most of it is used for supporting manufacturer's own bloatware and custom UIs. Not the case with Moto G.  The specs on paper are mid range at best, but due to the optimized KITKAT OS, the performance is on par with any high end phone. 1080p Video playback is flawless and most of the high end 3D games run just fine.  The battery is also something that made me skeptical at first, but again, the number game is at play here as well. The 2000 odd mAH battery seems small when compared to any other high end phone, but the battery backup for me with moderate to heavy usage is 5 hours of screen on time and full 24 hours of total runtime on a single charge. On heavy usage, it reduces to about 18 hours total and 3.8-4 hours of screen on time. This is on 3G only, with Wifi only in the evening and morning times before and after office, about 1 hour of calling, 1.5-2 hours of music, half an hour of video, whatsapp and facebook at regular breaks etc.   The only Con I can think of is the flimsy back cover, opening it is hard at least on a new phone and it bends as well. Plus, the power on off button is a little too much used and might get wear and tear in long run.  Overall, its a great phone for a great price, for those who are looking for a Nexus like experience. I would say go for it! :)  As usual, Flipkart's service was great, delivery was on time as promised. One suggestion I would like to give is to enhance the tracking system a little to show updates in a more detailed and frequent manner. After purchasing a product, the eagerness to get the product in our hands sometimes crosses boundaries :D",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,4 stars,Good Overall Performer,"I have ordered Moto G on 2nd Nov. 2014 and received it on 15th Nov 2014. So clearly thumbs down to the delivery. I could have got it at least 3-4 days earlier.  As far as the phone is concerned I am satisfied with its performance. I have made a list of pros and cons after the initial usage. Pros 1. Brilliant Display: Really liked the display. It is easily readable in bright sunlight. 2. Early updates: Curiously waiting for lollipop update. 3. Build Quality: The phone is very sturdy and feels premium to hold. Sound: Sound quality of speakers is very good if not excellent. 4. Camera: I have used Moto G(2013) and I can say that the camera has improved. The images turned out sharp and the colour accuracy was also spot on.  Cons: 1. Battery: 2070 mAh battery is just not enough for a hd display, no matter how good battery saver app you've installed or no matter how efficiently the o/s manages it. A little bit of gaming and HD videos decrease a considerable percentage of the battery's charge. So you need have a power bank all the time. 2. RAM: It has 1GB of RAM which is somewhat on a lower side. You won't notice that in normal usage scenario but if you have installed lot of apps, while playing games you'll notice drop in frame rate. But that's only when you play heavy game(meant for snapdragon 400 processor). You won't notice a thing while playing casual games. Earphones: I my opinion if you're spending 13k on a phone you should get something good. Earphones provided are just mediocre. Very low on volume and no bass at all. Charger: The wall charger provided is just 550mA which takes ages to charge the phone. You can buy a 2A charger.  Conclusion One can overlook all the cons for its vanilla o/s which results in slick performance. But the only deal breaker is the battery which is a serious cause of concern for a person who is consistently on the go.",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Packing was great. All in all have been happy with Flipkart as ever.  Has been a week since I have started using Moto G. Works exactly as I had expected.I like the design of the phone and it is very easy to hold and operate.   Look & Feel: > The 2 speaker strips, in my humble opinion, actually give a pretty good look to the phone...at times it did confuse me though about the the orientation of the phone as it looks same from both ends except for the front cam on top...lol ..but thats nothing to worry about. Back cover is very soft and smooth to touch and feels great in the hand.  Display: > Screen colours are pretty amazing, crisp and clear.  Battery: > Battery is working very well, and after a normal day usage is only coming down to around 45-50% by the evening, when I reach home and charges back up pretty quickly.  Camera: > I love the camera on this phone, though takes a bit of to do for getting used to it, after that it takes great pics even whn compared to other 8MP cams such as that of Nexus 5. Zoom clarity is pretty good. > Slo Motion HD video recording is the one I like the most in this for video. > Also the Macro pics taken from this cam have pretty amazing clarity from almost 1-2 inch distance. Auto focus combined with setting your own region to focus works great.  Sound & Music: > Moto have outdone themselves with this one. The software coding for sound output is extremely amazing and the Media effects included with the default player have more than 20 diffeent setting for Wired/Headphone speakers or the mobile's dual speakers separately. > Stereo quality of the mobile speakers is great. When I first got it and was listen to some stereo track I had to literaly check that where is the sound coming from because the stereo is soooo great that it felt like the music was playing from behind the mobile. > Mobile's sound output to my 2.1 Surround system is just great and pretty pretty loun, so much so that 50-60% output is more than enough.  Processor and Operation/Graphics: >No lags as of now and pretty optimized ram usage. CPU management is also well balanced, keeping unrequired CPU core in sleep/standby mode so as to save batery. >Pretty decent graphics with no lag whatsoever even on graphic intensive games.  Transciever and WI-Fi: > Clear sound reception and transmission with a powerful tranciever, recieving signal strength even in places where my last mobile hardly caught any signal. > Wi-Fi Hotspot is the weakest area of the phone. The range of the wifi hotspot is very less and as compared to my last phone it is not even half of it range. The only drawback I have found in this phone is this. Still it works pretty well.",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase
Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,1 star,VERY DELICATE GORILLA GLASS-BREAKS EASILY.,"Hi, bought Moto G2 and hardly used for 15 days, when kept the phone in my jeans and after little bike ride i am surprised to see that top left corner of the glass is broken, on internet search i found so many complaints of broken glass.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,Amaing phone!,"I bought this phone because I was sick of using my Moto E (also purchased on Flipkart). Got delivered in a day. It looks exactly like the Moto E from the back, except that it is larger. The Moto E sports a smaller grille for the front-top speaker, while the grilles are of equal size on the Moto G. The placement of the volume rocker and power/lock button are exactly the same as on the Moto E - which actually doesn't make for great design. While using the phone in the dark, it is easy to inadvertently push the power/lock button instead of the volume /-, which can be very frustrating. The battery life is only so-so. I keep my screen at lowest brightness, mobile data off and use only WiFi, but even then the battery does not last for more than 6-8 hours. However, given a phone of this screen size, I guess that's all right. Getting the back cover off is a pain, but it is somewhat easier if you start by prying the back off from the micro USB port on the phone. The phone performance is good, but still leaves me wishing it had more RAM - especially while using apps like Skype. During voice calls, switching to another app causes Skype to crash or the call to get dropped - I'm not sure if this has got something to do with the Skype app itself or the phone's memory management. Similarly, while switching between apps, I often see that some apps load all over again after a simple app-switch. I am now eagerly waiting for the Android 5.0 update.",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

( non stop poor customer service from flipart) 4 non availiability of moto phones with other online shopping sites makes us to no choice to get from flipkart and my personal opinion that all moto products bust be available in all online shopping site so that we can have fair play since flipkart is providing poor serivice we can swtich to some other provide but this is not happening so blame on MOTOROLA 5 1 gb ram slowest amoung other competitors in the same price range, even though phone does it lag that much but once u load more apps u can find considerable amount of lag in the phone. 6 charge ur phone is similar to RAHUL DRAVID getting 100 runs in 375 balls ... i have used so many devices never ever seen a phone that gets nearly 3 hrs to get charged and i dont know wat charges are provided with this phon 7 another in box accesories is hear phone and very poor quality even micromax hear phone that they give for NITRO which is also in the price bracket is good.  over all UNHAPPY with the device and very much FEDUP with FLIPKART service ........ motorola please look into the issue and help us ... one man cant satisfy all the needs of india ... lets try to be practicle and encourge fair trade and also there by increase the customer satisfaction.  all the above comments are my own and i faced all those difficults mentioned as cons over there  sorry to mention only one PRO is NOTHING.  regards sekher",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

I'm still trying to find faults and will update if I do. But none so far! Edit: Ok, I remembered one fault.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,4 stars,Very good product and worth for buying and well condition no complaints,"Hi guys,  Product was attractive and good in condition No complaints about moto G2. Good handling, good camera even during night. Good battery than samsung those i have used yet. Only no offers with product. Over all best for price. Touch and handling also good. Only i have not tested with GPS as i heard from my friend he also has moto G2. He says phone gets little bit heat but SAR retting is High than samsung phones but within limits provided by government of India. check ur phone SAR rating press *#07# and keep ur health better.  i would like to say thanks to seller they have provided good product. But can u guys provide some offers with product or those who have already taken another product from same seller like another phone same moder or not same model vice versa.  so they should give some offers or discount in cost referring old order no. so the buyer and seller relation of trust will increase and seller can increase their sell. It will much appreciated if seller will contact us and give some offers to there old buyer. waiting feedback or reply from seller.   As i have already taken Moto G2 and One samsug grand Prime from same WS seller. I am planning to take another samsung grand prime but within one week WS seller have increased there product price around 800rs already there product price is higher compare to other seller then why again they are increasing price. This will affect there sell.   I ordered Moto G2 on 29th OCt at 12999rs. then Samsung Grand Prime at 15056 rs on 6th Nov and received by 9th Nov But now i wanted to Order another Samsung Grand Prime but its price shows 15893 rs. Request u to give some offers or reduce the product price otherwise it will affect ur sell or people will move to other seller.

But after the Entry of Motorola moto g I was confused which one to buy. Later I got that having many features does not make phone work good. Asus produces best laptops but they are new in mobile field, they may give many features, but the working differs on many grounds. Now, something about hardware Glass is gorilla corning glass 3  N study frame. Overall strong enough in daily use. Software are something to talk about Google gives best software, but few are resource hungry For instance Google chrome which you can disable in setting but cannot uninstall.

Water Resistant  5. Good Gorilla Glass that resist Scratches  6. Slik Design  7. Available in EMI Option through Credit Card.   Cons-  1. Phone slips from hand sometimes so be careful in handling 5 inch mobile. Go for Insurance worth Rs 1000 within 15 Days from Invoice Date.  2.Sharp edges between Glass and Body at left upper corner so you feel uncomfortable when talking to somebody.  3. Music is good but not Good as Sony mobiles.  4. Motorola Flip Cover cost is Rs 1100 which is very costly. Motorola should reduce its cost and should provide it in Rs 500-700.  5. It heats when you use it till 30 minutes.  Rest OKAY. I would strongly Recommend to Purchase Moto G 2nd Gen.  Please donot go for 1st Gen as it is far better than 1st gen.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,Thumbs up for Moto! and Thumbs up for Flipkart!,First of all there is no issue with Flipkart delivery . I got my product the next day of my order and of course in a good packing. Thank you flipkart.  Coming to the Moto G 2nd gen.  Those who worry about 1gb ram in Moto G 2nd gen. I tell you just dont worry about it. It is good enough for all apps and multitasking has no lag. Just go for it.  Primary camera is good and front camera is decent.  Battery is also good but takes sometime to charge.  Internal memory of 16 gb is great advantage for the phone.,0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,Excellent Phone in price range,"I have been using it from last 2 months. Overall performance is great. But there is pros and cons to it.All pros have been listed by company.  Here are some of the problems with the phone 1. With 3G battery drains like usain bolt's 100m race and device heats up a bit but not too much.This problem exist in every device which runs on 3G . 2.In 3G touch doesn't work as smoothly as it works in 2G.  Some distinguished feature that stand out are 1. Camera is excellent compared to other company like sony's 8MP quality is really good. Flash works very effectively. 2.All popular android games run flawlessly,I am not talking about big games like FIFA 15. 3. Perfect size to fit in hand and quite light. 4. Display is brilliant compared to micromax phones.  ALL other specification mentioned in description is upto the mark.  If you are first time android user then it's best phone to choose. Guys who are confused between xiaomi and motorola,don't go for xiaomi especially if you have something important data in your phone for security purpose.  Overall considering all factors I would describe this phone in one word as AWESOME.",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,MOTO G 2 GEN user opinions and review,"Hey dude even I was confused like you a month a ago. But I've gone for moto And my reason is that Asus zenfone is quite an awesome phone in its budget and its UI is also way better than stock android. But the Intel chip under the hood even though its powerful it's battery hungry compared to the snapdragon in moto. I mean ya even this phone has less battery stand by but lemme tell you at least heating issue is not present. Its just warm that phone actually heats a lot when you use it a lot for navigation or gaming or HD video playback. Well, all I wanna say is heating issue is a bad thing for both phones and health. For phones because battery and chip set life decreases and health coz the radiation coming out will be even more stronger as the battery drains fast resulting in faster transmission making it harmful( not literally till you die) but just mentioning. But trust me there is no regret in both the phones. Any of the both just makes you satisfactory for the money you spent.",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase
Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,4 stars,Its good phone but..,"First hats off to flipkart's service. I orderd it on 30th oct. in morning and got it on 1st nov. at around 4in evening. Now about phone..i was in love with this and its previous version from start.I'm writing this review after using it for about 1week. This is my first smart phone.Now about phone... 1) Its charger is not having USB cable while most of other companies provide it. 2) Charger heats up like anything after charging for about an hour. 3) WiFi connectivity is not that good.It took me around 1and half hour to download asphalt 8,while my brother downloaded it on his Asus Zenphone in about half hour on same connection. 4) Battery backup is ok ok. 5) Asphalt 8 runs on it smoothly but after playing 5-6 races device heats up and game shuts down and doesn't start after that till device cools down. 6) It would've been great if RAM was little more. If i've to recommend it to someone then i would also suggest them Zenphone 5. Its screen is brilliant.. I played 4K video on it.It didn't run fluently but atleast i was able to see images. On the other hand Zenphone didn't even played sound. And one more thing its AnTuTu Benchmark score was fluctuating between 17500 to 20k.",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,1 star,DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE ... ALMOST NO SERVICE IF DEVICE HAS ISSUES AFTER 30 DAYS.,Guys I just wanna share my bad experience about this phone and do not want anyone else to face this kinda experience again. I got a manufacturing defect on the phone and I realized this after 30 days. So obviously I can not contact flipkart (they are hell bent against making any kind of exceptions to the 30 day policy) so I gave my mobile to the service center for part replacement. It has been three weeks so far without a phone. The service center is Sri Sai Communications in Secunderabad and they have three numbers and no number works. I called Motorola they said that the part is not available for replacement. So I asked them timeline when the phone might get back to me and they are not sure about that. I wish there was a zero rating too so I can mark it for this product. I wrote to the zonal manager of Motorola and no reply back from him too. I called flipkart again and they again said waioot for another week and see. Guys 4 weeks without a phone these days can you imagine .... and no one is taking ownership of the issue. I am thinking about going to consumer forum for the issue now. Phone is considered to be a emergency device now and I am without it for 4 weeks( still I do not have the mobile) ... I am completely at the mercy of the service center folks now .... Guys if you wanna risk your money experimenting about the mobile then go for it otherwise I suggest that buy some other phone whivh has good network of service centres in the country.,0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase
Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,wot a phone for wot i pay,"I got it on exchange for nokia asha 206 an year old bought from flipkart an year ago. As soon as i got the box i found out:  1. phone looks sleek and amazing. 2. black fone, white charger and handsfree...what a turn off and NO DATA CABLE. 3. It MOTO and start off was amazing. So there is no menu button it ok...its not samsung...and no camera button  phone's fast and amazing. Google support is great. No file manager...but thats the first thing that i got from google play.  SO HERE IS THE ACTUAL REVIEW AFTER 1 MONTH'S USE  Pros: 10k after giving my old non smart fone, for such an amazing phone kudos flipkart. phone is fast, good graphic support 5 inch screen wow. decent audio op  good camera and hd video resolution...good video op its light weighted, fits in my pocket looks classy the back cover is rubber coating i think..gives a good grip for sweaty hands while playing games on the run. google gives me all the updates in one page, date time, cricket score, football updates, news, My location, mode of transport available from my current location to my home, my work schedule also tells me when im getting off from work ""Time to go home"" message comes up!!! :) YES ON ONE PAGE!!!! moto assist helps me a lot. Phone goes on silent automatically if i program it to go off daily at a particular time and vice a versa. and many other features... AND so much memory omg...my phone has 197 apps and games i still have 110gb internal memory left with my 16 gb memcard full of movies and cartoons and other stuffs.  cons: Battery is a suck up..drains out faster. I multitask on the phone...play temple run while listening to music and 3g connected...hardly stays up for 4 hours straight.but thanks to power bank IM HAPPY There is no timer on camera. I like clicking picks and i sort of find it irritating. sometimes hangs...but its android...its bound to happen. sometimes...rarely...the fone heats up...i can make omlettes on the mobile cheap earphones...so i use zagg. phone hangs sometimes when i connect to wifi.  I have a samsung s4, blackberry, iphone 4s and lumia720. I'll say...MOTO G2 is a gamer's delight..",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,1 star,Worst experience,"Bought two Moto G 2nd Gen on Big billion day.  One phone is okay even though did not meet the expectation  However I had the worst experience with Flipkart  The phone started loosing network conectivity and raised a complaint against it. It took 1 month to days to resolve the issue. Customer support people told that the phone will be replaced on or before 29th October 2014. I got this information on 18th October 2014. I had to format the defect piece and keep it ready for pickup. DID NOT KNOW WHEN WILL THEY PICK UP. I did not have a phone till then. On 29th 12.44 PM, I got a message saying your product has been dispatched for delivery. 12.45 PM i got another message saying you rejected the product.!@#$  Again started battling with Flipkart. Then finally November 10, 2014 they sent me another phone to replace, a defect piece.   I could not here anything but the called at the other end could here me. Same time voice for media was working correctly.  Again started interacting with customer support. Finally yesterday that is 14th November 2014 they took the product back and I have to wait for my refund now.  Also I need to search for another phone. From the day I choose to buy a phone in Flipkart, I am just like a person without mobile.  The issues in the phone was:  1. Network drop. Even on of my relative bought Moto E where he is also having the same issue. 2. Extream heat generated. Especially when you use internet or camera  3. Camera is average 4. Voice disturbance during calls.  Completely disappointed with Flipkart.  Goodbye Flipkart.",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Delivery was good, nicely packaged.

Lasts me a day with normal to heavy usage. -Stereo speakers are great and loud  Cons -Ram is just 1GB so when I'm playing heavy games and I come out of the game and go back to it, the game restarts -sometimes due to ram the launcher also restarts. but it takes only 1/2 a sec to restart so its not a big issue -front camera is not that good  In the end I would suggest that you should go and buy this product if you have a range between 10-15k.

Thankfully Replacement accepted and waiting for it .  OK coming to the review.I owned MOTO G 1st gen.It was awsome for its price.Still good deal for the price 9999.  Advantages of MOTO G  Good display (great display for the price),same for camera(since 5mp details are low but color reproduction is gr8),good sound(even its mono back speaker i find it loud and clear than moto g2)  Advantages of MOTO G2  Great display compared to moto g(i found color tone of MOTO G2 is warm and MOTO g is cool) Gr8 camera 8 mp serves its purpose(more details than moto g and far better ) Gr8 design and feel,feels slimmer and lighter than moto g(even though by specs its slighly thicker and heavier) about graphics and all....its mid range snapdragon 400 powered device...but no lags and issues...far better than samsung and all phones upto 25k price range can play almost all games...for heavy gamers go for moto x.  Disadvantages of moto G  I say its speaker quality poor....very poor(even though more instrument music is audible its still far behind moto g  So in simple for guys looking for new phone in price range 10k to 30k 1.usage moderate gaming and lots of social media normal day to day camera usage this is the phone   2.Heavy gamer more techy? wait for MI4. Moto x? still wait...i expect price to be drop soon...right price be 26k ...32k for 10.7gb useable memory ?

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,1 star,Moto G 2nd Generation - Issues with shuffling network connection from WiFi to 3G/2G,"I'm not happy with Moto G 2nd Generation and even after replacement. Below are the list of problems that I've encountered.  3G will not auto connect if no WiFi available until restart or rebooting the device. This is a major problem and I think it's a glitch with 2nd Generation.  Performance issues with the battery as it drains so fast even if you turn off GPS locations and other apps that chew battery.  Reducing volume (by pressing down side button) will lead to delay the volume for 10 secs as it will not happens immediately.  Due to the performance issues, device freeze for particular period unless you terminate applications. Even I've checked the RAM which is all clean with much space.  Finally, requested to replace but the new device has got similar issues even thought few were resolved. Buyers - I would recommend to go for 1st Generation rather 2nd one.

The camera is good, the storage is enough, the performance of the phone is fast for the RAM it has. Its not getting heated up after prolong use, the charge lasts long inspite of keeping 3G on for a long time and browsing the internet.  The speakers are not up to the mark, same with the ear phones provided. The ear phones are not the one which you can insert in your ears, which lacks the rubber ring, which would have been better if provided. when wearing and lying down, sure that the ear phones will drop, which is one point to be considered.  The charger provided is a normal one, not the one suitable for USB charging.  The over all rating is that, best buy for this price.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,1 star,Battery performance is very weak,"I got Moto G2 a week ago. I had Moto E previously. The reason i did go for Moto phone again is I had an exceptionally great battery back up experience with Moto E. But the same is not the case with this phone. The given 2070 mAh doesnt even get me through half a day . It hardly lasts for 5 hours with just one hour of 3G usage. The worst part is that if I turn on 3G connectivity battery power drops dramatically quick and the worst of all happens when I plug in the mobile for charging battery power keeps dropping and it takes a hell lot of time to get full charge. Additionally the mobile is heating up while charging. I have to use my mobile very frugally if I had to make it last for more than 10 hours. But that is not why we all buy smartphones and that is not how it works. I really didnt imagine Motorola has built a very good specs with 8MP cam, expandable memory, large screen size , good internal memory and everything around a pathetic battery life. All these are not made good use of if the battery performance is so poor . Wake up Moto !!  I would rather buy a new Moto E back again from flipkart instead of this one.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,4 stars,Awesome phone at 13K,"It is beautiful phone, with impressive software and hardware features.  Its been more than a month and it never hung a single time. works smooth.  If you are switching from Samsung, as it has stock android, absence of some small but basic features like hiding unnecessary inbuilt icons, setting separate wallpapers for lock screen and home screens, no file explorer, no inbuilt navigation app etc. may annoy you initially.  Use black wallpaper to save battery which may be concern to some buyers. (As per my observation it has significant impact on battery life to be honest).  The in-box charger charges phone at quite good speed.  If you are a nominal user of internet(3G) your battery may last more than 30 hours. If you are always streaming videos and are on phone for internet, it is not at all for you as you will feel that you are always out of charge.  *It is difficult (rather impossible for me) to charge from PC/laptop using USB cable. It just doesn't work for me. So you may be needed to carry plug charger with you all the time.  I did not buy it for camera, though taken pics still look great.  In-box earphones are a bit disappointment, not par with the quality/features of phone, it just seems to be liability than a complementing feature.  All in all I am giving 4 stars for other users who want to buy it.(performance + fair battery life - missing basic features - not so good earphones)  However for me it comes to around 4.5 stars as I hardly miss Samsung features in it. I love its speed and display. Also I use 4-6 hours of internet daily, around 1-2 hours in office and 4-5 hours at my home, and the battery lasts for around 30 hours for me, so not much issue with battery life as well.  Only issue is that it does not get charged by any USB cable (Motorola has not provided any in-box cable) so I need to carry charger with me all the time and provided earphones are bad quality earphones.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,Value for money Redefined,"Have been using the phone for 2 weeks .. Its fluid, fast looks and feels top notch.. Have been using flagship phones like the Htc One X and the 5S and realised that smartphones do have a life of just 2 years or maybe a pint more .. Switched to mid-range and been in the hunt for quite a long while ..   Like : Design and build quality is simply awesome , pure android and OTA updates , great front cam , stereo speakers, splash proof  Dislike : long calls do have crackle in voice quality , rear cam not that great and cam app missing basic effects , ear phones are just plain and un inspiring , miss a sync cable in box ..  Notes : Based on snapdragon 400 SOC its pretty fast and the battery lasts for a day .. waiting for android L update that could remove the bottleneck of battery and efficiency thanks to ART on L ...

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,4 stars,A good mid range device,"The design: Nothing outstanding but the curved back do helps in gripping the phone.  Screen: Good sun light legibility at 50% brightness levels  Build quality: For a careless person like me this assumes prime importance. The phone has been dropped 2-3 with screen downwards on tarred roads. Nothing has happened to the screen only plastic has chipped from upper edges.  Camera: Good camera. For all those complaining about poor camera. Enable touch focus and give camera sufficient time (2-3 seconds) to focus (Let the green colored circle appear before clicking). Cam has acceptable quality indoors.  Battery: lasts 12-15 hours with my usage (2G internet, screen on 3-4 hours, 1-2 hours of calling, 1 hour of games like subway surfer, Sudoku etc.)  Charging time: Default charger takes eternity to charge, heard slow charging is beneficial for battery life and only time will tell how long the battery lasts  Do NOT compare it to phones like MI3 which are targeted at different segments. Mi3 has its own advantages but nothing can provide vanilla android experience at this price point. IMHO, user experience matters more than anything else. Hardcore android loyalists will appreciate Moto G (second gen) while the MiUi rom lovers will prefer Mi3. To each his own.  P.S. Posting this review after 2 months of usage. Phone has hanged 2-3 times. If your phone is stuck, just press the power button for 7-10 seconds to bring it back to life",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase
Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,Still the best budget smartphone,"Moto G review (2014): still the best budget smartphone Last year's Moto G took us all by surprise. Sure, we knew Motorola wanted to reinvent the cheap smartphone experience, but the very first device in the company's cost crusade was even better than we expected. Let's be honest, though: The G's greatest asset was its small, it became awfully easy to forgive the thing for not being the quickest, the prettiest or the smartest. Still, it was one of those gadgets that wound up being more than just ""good enough""; between the price and performance, the Moto G was one of the best cheap smartphones you could own, period.  Here we are less than a year later, and we've got a sequel to play with (one with the same name, no less). If you took a quick peek at what it brings to the table, you'd be forgiven for thinking that Motorola wanted to play it safe the second time around -- the new Moto G2 isn't a game changer, and it doesn't have to be. Does this year's model clear the ""good enough"" bar once again?   Moto G (2014)  PROS  Camera is much better than the original's Near-stock Android 4.4.4 is a treat Feels snappy despite aging internals Inexpensive CONS  No LTE Screen isn't as crisp as last year's model SUMMARY Motorola's wallet-friendly formula hasn't changed much since last year's Moto G, but that's OK -- the company changed just enough to make the 2014 version one of the best budget smartphones out there.",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,2 stars,Average Phone... And Flipkart is a cheater,Phone is goods in looks and the black one better then white. Flipkart is selling refurbished phone at the price of new one. I got my phone with scratches on the lower side of bezel. So i ordered for a replacement. Got another one with a huge noticable gap between the bezel and screen glass. So very dissappointed by the build quality of motorola. Had to keep it because can't take a risk what if the other one came with more deffects.  Cons :1. Poor Battery.. get drained itself even without using the phone.. upto rate of 3% per hour even on standby. 2.Speakers are not of good quality.. Sound is not very clear. 3.Mic is not also very good.. Sometime you have to repeat again and again to make the other party hear you. 4. Accessories with the phone are of no use.. cheap quality headphones.. even the charger is of very cheap quality. Accessories supplied with the phone likes samsung guru are more better.  Phone is average.

If you have a budget below 15k, this is the only phone that you should get. Don't fall for more cores, bigger RAM or higher GHz advertised by other companies, just go for this.  The only thing missing in the phone is NFC, which I doubt anyone in India even uses, and if you have a use case for NFC, you're most likely not the target audience.

It would had been much much Better if they would had increased the RAM...But Yeah The Dead line Looking around..its simply THE Best among its Competitor..Its Just 12999/- And at this Price Its a Superb Buy and to those who has a Budget of 16K and wants to Buy a Mobile!

When i couldn't activate the offer, I got back to the customer care, who came back saying that the offer wasn't there when I placed t.he order This was a blatant and shameless lie.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,"Amazing Delivery by Flipkart, Awesome phone by Motorola","I am very happy with the speed, care and professionalism with which my product was delivered. The mobile was delivered to me, intact, just on the third day of placing the order! And I loved how I could actually track where my mobile is, and so calculate the time it will take to be delivered to me.  Flipkart was there to help me from day one of the order. Thanks guys!  About the Phone: Pros- Amazing looks Good Battery life Android experience is great as its the latest version so it feels very premium Display is just amazing and crisp Smooth scrolling and touch experience.  Gyrosphere, 3d, parralex, OpenGl works great Great voice quality, the speakers are very loud Great sound quality, connectivity and other features. Moto Assist is great and updates also work fine Dual Sim works fantastic! Blinking light works whenever there is missed call, notification or alert. Android 4.4.4 experience is out of this world Camera has pre-loaded effects which is a good thing. Has 1 Gb Ram but does multi-tasking smoothly. Ear phones can control the music, which is good. Music and Movies is already installed and the Music player and movie player are very good, with many options.  Cons- Camera is very poor SlowMo in the video doesn't work as it should have. It gets heated while surfing the net, but not so much. Battery is not very good. Heavy using can discharge battery quickly. No data transfer cable is available. Had to buy one PC-mobile data cable extra. Even in day the pictures aren't that great. Earphones should have been of a better quality.  Conclusion:  If you're planning of buying this phone but are confused...Don't wait.. just place the order NOW! Trust me, you won't regret.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,Moto G Second Gen: Bigger and Better,"Great phone for the price, nice feel, solid performance. As a 3 generation iphone user, I got tired of jailbreaks and work arounds. I was worried about performance and the camera. I had a short stint with a Nexus One that left me with a bit of a sour taste for Android so this was a big leap.  The phone is fast, the only thing that seems to make it hang a bit are large web pages, jumping back to the home screen can take 1-2 seconds, but everything else seems as fast or faster than my iphone 5 with 7.1.2. Battery life is just as good as the iphone.  The screen is amazing and the biggest surprise is the camera, the daytime photos are fantastic. Nighttime are slightly worse than the iphone but the day shots are just that much better.  Overall a fantastic phone and a pleasure to use. This is one of those devices that is greater than the sum of its parts (or specs).",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase
Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,4 stars,Happiness in the box.........!!!!!!,"First of all Thanks to flipkart delivery, it was awesome as usual . Now THE MOTO G 2nd GEN received it today .  the moment when i opened the box, there was a big smile on my face, the looks killed me :D everything is good, the display, the sound quality of front speaker(by default they are set to bass punch so you might get disappointed with its so called ""fatti hui awaz"". you can adjust it) now come to the big question... ""THE BATTERY"" as i received it today.... battery backup i got was not so impressing we can say its just average, but Motorola claims that battery will give its maximum backup after 10-11 charges, as it is being calibrated within this time. LETS SEE. some people complained that phone is getting heated while charging but mine does not, heating can also be a reason of high/low voltage or etc. but yes battery takes time to charge because of its low Amp charger. . .

USB Cable- U cannot transfer movies onto your mobile, it will get disconnect and reconnect in between (already tried with various data cables and also tried with diff mobiles with same data cable and sd card) 5. Games Crash- HD games will carsh after using for 1 ~ 1.5month or so.. if you tell this to moto cust care they will reply to uninstall and reinstall.  I already address this issues..

Costly Damage-Repair charges : For Moto G 1st Generation, if your screen gets damaged, it may coast around INR 5100 and for Moto G 2nd Generation around INR 7000. Not a comfortable deal. :(   Camera Hang issue : During capturing images, it becomes frustrating, when screen gets hanged. Then I have to restart the camera to use it.

Music sounds better if you get some proper headphones than the ones shipped with this phone. I was an iPhone user and was concerned about shelling out another high amount on a phone.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,Great product,"Love this phone.....wanted Mi3 or redmi but cudnt get them. Also redmi didn't have kitkat then and moto g would get Android lollipop first so went for it. Its a solid phone. Display is sharp, front speakers are loud and the best feature of the phone. Cameras are average. Redmi has much better cameras both front and back. Battery is average too. It lasts just about a day on my low to moderate usage. The phone otherwise is quite fast and fluid. For heavy multitasking, it can stutter but then even iphone 5 does. Good product overall but i really feel the price is high, considering zenfone 5 comes at just 10K and the flagship in this range, REDMI comes at just half the price. Its a great phone but if you can get hands on REDMI....go for it. wouldn't recommend it over REDMI.",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,Simply Brilliant!,"When it comes to the Moto G, every review talks about how great this phone is at this PRICE POINT. To me, this is a great phone..PERIOD.  I have not LOVED a phone this much since my Samsung Galaxy S2. I have used Sammies for a long time now and I was curious to see what 11k (got 2K off on this on the Big Billion offer on exchange of my wife's old Sony Ericsson Xperia mini pro) would get me. Boy was I pleasantly surprised!  The Moto G (2) looks as decent and the build quality is as good as any other phone out there. Only the power and volume rocker keys feel a bit flimsy but do their job perfectly well.I love the curved rubberized back and the phone feels just right in the hand. It feels so compact in the hand for a 5 incher, especially when compared to the Samsung Grand duos.  How great is that splash screen on boot up!! The screen is clear and sharp and while the colors don't POP they are natural, quite like the HTC palette.  Everything on this phone just WORKS and works QUICK! There is no lag whatsoever after a month of use. I was frankly concerned about the 1 gig of RAM but there seems to be no need whatsoever for more. I don't use the phone for gaming so I cannot comment on that. I cannot understand why most reviews talk about potential battery life issues just because of the bigger screen. I am getting more than 24 hours with wifi, 3 g, location services and bluetooth on permanently. I charge the phone for a couple of hours in the evening and by next evening i still have 25-50% charge left!  Stock Android Kit Kat flies through every (multi) task.There is no bloatware and the few preinstalled Motorola apps are actually useful. I do miss some of the shortcuts (swipe to call and text etc) and other extras (File browser, flip to silence) that came with Touchwiz but its certainly something I can live with given the sheer speed with which everything gets done.  Connectivity is fantastic..leave everything on and it seamlessly switches between Wifi and 3G, and bluetooth goes into a low power standby state when not connected to a paired device.  The camera is decent and very quick to start up. I actually like the Motorola camera app because it lets you access and change the settings very quickly and access to the gallery from within the camera app is just one swipe away. In phone editing options are good as well.  The front facing stereo speakers, while short on bass, are loud and clear. The bundled headphones went straight into the bin, but lets face it, even an iPhone's stock buds are no good. One final point, and this is something that no one seems to care about these days...this, after all, is A PHONE, and when used as a phone, the call clarity is EXCELLENT, enough to put those costing 3 times as much to shame.  Motorola, in Google's hands, has really done an impressive job with this one. What the future holds under Lenovo only time will tell. If they can keep this up, I, for one, will never blow my hard earned money on a ""flagship"" phone again!!",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

I got a call from Flipkart service center. The person gave some troubleshooting steps and said the issue would be resolved. I thought since I haven't updated the result of troubleshooting, the request's status would be 'In Progress' but to my surprise the status was 'Replacement Rejected' How can the request be rejected when my issue was not resolved? Thoroughly disappointed by the way Flipkart's Customer Care team handles replacement requests.  Have raised another request in the system.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,After 15 days of usage.. An honest Review,"> Well to start with, the design, I would say, is the best.. The curved body fits perfectly in the hand... The ports are placed in perfect positions and it does really give a great look when held.. > Next, the camera, I still wonder if the front one is really 2mpx .. It feels like a 5mpx cam .. The shots in the front and back are solid, but it clearly misses some details in natural daylight .. That is one big con with the phone, but considering the price, I would say it is the best... > The touchscreen is buttery smooth and the response is great.. I haven't seen any phone respond so quick..  > Speakers : Dual ?? Really ?? Not that great.. Yes it is loud but not really clear.. > Battery standby is not up to the mark.. But if you are a mid range user, you could expect it to stand for a full day.. I tried using it continuously in 3G and i had to recharge after 4 hours.. So battery, honestly not good, not even close to good.. Could have been better even in this price range.. Maybe with the lollypop update, we could expect more > Stock android experience is great.. Still waiting for Lollypop update.. > The sensors, yes they work good.. I installed CPU-Z and found about 10 sensors and I don't know most of its working.. > RAM could have been better.. But if you are not a heavy user, you need not worry, Just go for it.. > The supplied headset could have been better and data cable is missing.. Price has no effect on the accessories supplied.. So it could have been better..  >> On the whole, this phone stands up to the expectations, but of course, could have been better... I would recommend this phone for mid range users.. If you are a heavy user, strictly don't buy this..   Considering the price and specs, I would rate it 4.75 (5 in stars) If not for the battery, I would have rated it 5..",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

After charging the mobile for sometime I tried to switch it on, it took a long time, I thought this is the very first time that's why it's taking some time. Then I tried to switch it off, but every time I pressed the power button it was taking screenshot. Some times the power button was working as volume key. For long pressing of the power button the device was getting restarted in lieu of getting switched off. How can flipkart deliver a product which costs 14000 bucks without even minimal checking of basic functionality. I mean the power button is screwed up, the first and foremost function!

Earlier I was using Canvas4 mobile and I decided to buy this (with little bit of hesitation due to negative reviews in web sites). But I feel I am lucky to choose MotoG2. The phone has an awesome cool display resolution and clarity with a 5"" screen. Touch response is smooth and faaast,, It Can run full HD videos, arcade games or multitasking with out any lag. GPS is extremely responsive with in milliseconds when turned on. Loudspeaker is front facing and can hear the phone ringing even while driving, Screen is quite clear and visible in direct sunlight with basic display brightness settings itself. I am not using any screen guard till now and I can hardly find any scratches in the screen after a weeks use(Thanks for Gorilla corning 3).Camera quality is decent under sufficient light exposure. Lollipop OS upgrade will roll on soon.. What more do you expect from a smart phone at this price range..? Just go for it- Now coming to the Cons section.(It doesn't bother me though) Battery back up is not up to the mark (I need to charge twice a day) Not rigid like Canvas 4.

When contacted flipkart support, rather correcting on their side, support was suggesting me that they will cancel the order, and i have to place a new order. which was not feasible as i had to make another transaction of 12999 . and i had to wait for 7-8 days for my earlier payment to get returned.  4.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,3 stars,Skeptical with my new Moto G2,"As a package for the price, it's an excellent phone. Sleek, light, great configuration etc. However, it's just over 10 days I am using it, but perplexed about couple of issues already.  1. While on call, the voice gets feeble often, in almost all calls. I initially thought the person other end isn't holding their handset properly, however, I realized it's not the case after clarifying it a couple of times. Moreover, we can see a lot of others raised the same issue too.  2. The voice / music on headset speaker is distorted. Not expected as the dual front speaker is one of the key USPs of this phone.  3. Started lagging! Strange, considering the pure stock Android OS and great configuration. The animation / graphics isn't smooth as it generally when you get back to the home screen. It lags for a second and all icons appears together without any animation.  That's for now. Do they have fixtures or need to look for replacement?

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,4 stars,Value for Money! Go for it!,"After using it for month. Yes, price to performance ratio is important. but Quality also matters and Moto G 2014 will give you that! Specs doesn't matter at all. Apple is proving that every second but those are high end phone. not made for common man. If you are a student or on a tight budget. buy moto g 2014 and you won't regret your choice.oh! Lollipop is on the way! :-D Still I gave 4 star not 5, why? Rear Camera is not that great. I mean you are getting what you paid for and maybe more but don't compare to other 8mp SmartPhones. also color don't feel realistic and processor is old but again specs are not that important.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,4 stars,"AWESOME PHONE!!!!!!!!!! but,,,,","Let me put the review in a simple way,, PROS: 1.Processor is too good,no lag during usual operations,but i have observed lag of only 1-2 seconds while multitasking. 2.Display is awesome. 3.camera quality and features are better than moto g first gen. 4.Easy to access dual sim settings. 5.front speakers are loud n clear.  CONS: 1.Performance of the Battery is one of the major problems of this phone,it takes 3.5 hours to get charged from 14% to 90%.Also for optimum use the discharge period is 7.5-8 hours.But if you use phone for high end games,continues 3g network and carryout multitasking,the battery life reduces to 5.5-6 hours 2.In box accessories are pathetic.The ear phones are not of good quality and charger is also not impressive. 3.Battery heats up severely.  VERDICT:MOTO G 2nd GEN is awesome phone with very few drawbacks.A more than worth buy for its price.But it is definitely not a phone for game gigs,unless you can carry a power bank.",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase
Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,Review after 2 week usage. Hats off to flip kart service. just go for it !!,"i ve got this hone on 14 of Nov so this is a well examined review.  first impression was awestruck. i ordered a black one and it is beautiful . i love it most because of it unique look when screen is locked its pure black .  Build quality- built quality is nowhere compromised . it feels rich and comfortable on handing and it is surprisingly usable with single hand despite of 5 inch. it is too handy and fun to use  Features - i will not brag about the obvious features that you can find anywhere on net, but what i liked most about this phone it it supports any game you can think of and it runs too well. if u are a gaming kind of person it is for you.  notification light is beautiful. no seriously it is too pleasing.  Being a Google phone its like icing on cake. voice command and assist are the features for real use lot just for name.  Battery backup- i seriously want to highlight it BATTERY BACKUP IS NOWHERE LESS. i ve been using it for a long lime and i have no complaints it gives a back up of 8-10 hrs on nominal use and continuous WiFi usage which is not at all bad for a 5 inch screen phone. but the only prob is when you are playing high end games u can see a drop of 10-15% battery in 15 mins.so get POWER BANK in that case.  Performance- overall performance of this device is 4 at the scale of 5.   cons- Heating problem - this device gets heated up very soon. while gaming and also while using some heavy application it gets significantly heated up.  sound output - it is amazing during calls very clear and crisp but if you are willing to listen music at loud speaker it will be a disappointment. sound in feeble and also poor in quality. Also you will have to buy a new headset because stock headset are just OK nothing more than that. sound output is very low.  HATS OFF TO FLIP KART  by this purchase flip kart seriously won my heart . i bought 2 sets out of which one was getting too much heated up. i just called up and complained. second day i got a call back and with due Curtsy they asked me to hard reset the phone i did it and reported back that problem is not solved. i received a call and without any request and obligation they just told me that i ll get a new phone with in 3 days and it will be an hand to hand replacement. i mean seriously it so simple !! i bet you will not get this kind of service at any store and at any cost.   just go for it guys its i the best deal you can get under 16k",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,4 stars,"Looks good, more later (after extensive use)","1. Flipkart delivery one day before committed date.  2. Handset looks good with white back cover  3. Moto G had a small (6-8"") Data Cable but 2nd Gen has none; guess, it's cost cutting measure  4. I had earlier bought a Moto G for 11,999 which had two major manufacturing defects:  (1) sound quality when speaking to anyone including Flipkart; and  (2) battery began to show bulges within a week of delivery.   Flipkart took it back and sent to manufacturer, and credited my wallet a/c with 11,999.   After debating for a month whether to or not to, I made up my mind, added 1,000 to the kitty, and ordered for Moto G 2nd Gen for 12,999 (say, 13,000 those 999s are deceptive)  This time as I opened the back cover to put in SIM card, I noticed the battery isn't any more visible. Result: user can't keep a watch if the battery is drying up too soon to be acceptable.  Motorola too has learned from experience of earlier model what to reveal and what not to.  5.

Pros.... 1) No Lags - Every User primarily looks at this thing first, simply no lags, even after forcing my phone to show me some it failed showing any..... What else do you need :)  2) Phone is Handy - Fits in my palm so no need to use both hands and doesnt fall on my face when using it lying down on my bed :P  3) Light weight - As compared to my A110 its Light.... enough said  4) Durable - I actually dropped my phone the other day from a height of 4 feet and had a mini Heart Attack but lucky me its still working no scratch nothing :P remembered those days when i used to fling my Nokia phones around without worrying about a single thing...... :) (Warning dont try this stunt you will end up loosing all that you paid for)  5) Probably I think I was the first one to get an update as no one mentioned about it at that time 10th Sep'14 to be precise :D as soon as i unboxed the phone and connected it to my WiFi I had an update waiting, so expecting Lollipop sooner than other folks :P  6) Sound - OMG the sound is awesome, Dual speakers blow the sound like a stereo set, that is if you have the right media  7) No Heating - Unlike other I didnt notice any heating during calls it only gets heated if Im under the sun for a long time with my Phone exposed to it ... (Its a Black Phone, and Black absorbs Heat, so no complaints)   8) 12.9GB free internal storage - Yes all the apps you want to fill in your phone, Currently I have 94 excluding the pre-installed, so this is enough to prove the phone doenst lag  9) No Boltware - Purely stock android, that means no unwanted apps pre-installed which you wont be using  10) Looks Rich - Yes It does look elegant  11) Games - Works smooth FIFA 14, FIFA 15, Real Racing 3, temple Run works smooooth except for subway surf it lags a bit again no complaints coz my Sis is a crazy fan of Subway and she noticed lags in almost every phone she played on, so no complaints  Cons... 1) charge time 3 hrs - Thats not good coz im a impatient man  2) Camera - Camera is a bit grainy in the indoor's but is excellent in the Outdoors..  3) Ringtone - ascending ringtone wastes 3 second of ring time   4) only ~300mb ram free (Doesnt make a difference to me if there is no lags and no force close, Its only for the Ram hungry guys out there )  hunting for more !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! and yes awaiting Android Lollipop..................",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,2 stars,Good Phone with Bad Display Glass quality,"Everything is fine with this phone except the build quality of the display glass. It fell from a height of 2 feet and the glass was smashed. Similar thing happened with a colleague of mine, who did not even drop his phone. The worst thing is that the motorola service centre in chennai is so bad that firstly they don't even pick your calls, so you have to visit them personally just to find out that the replacement costs around Rs. 6000 which is half the cost of the phone. Phone's performance itself is good, but if you are even a little bit of rough user, do not buy this phone.",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase
Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,4 stars,Worth for money and Not much excited with appearance compared to Moto G 1st Gen.,"Got the phone and used for a month. Here is my review on the gadget.  Pros:  - Memory expandable feature (with micro SD slot). - Speakers output on front side. - Camera 8 MP rear and 2 MP front. - Updated Android v4.4.4 (KitKat) OS. - Screen size 5-inch HD Screen.  Cons:  - Screen Resolution Display Appearance is not so good as 1st Gen Moto G. - ICON size is big, which looks odd. (no option to reduce). - There is no 2-in-1 Charger cum Data cable. - No LED indication when device is charge. - Poor Back.  Verdict:  As I mentioned worth for your penny with upgraded features and missed out the durability of the device when compared to 1st Gen Moto G.  If your are looking for a best MANGO in this price range, just go for this.",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,4 stars,5 start to this product and flipkart service,"Hi All,  Now it is my turn to write a review. After reading lots of good reviews I have decided to buy this product. I ordered(OD100945372712260100) and with exceptional flipkart service I received it on 8th of Oct 2014. I switched on ...but to my surprised nothing appeared on screen, instead there was burning secession on my fingers. I tried multiple time but failed to switch on the device. Initially burning smell was coming out but stopped after few minutes. Unfortunately this time the device was not switched on.   I requested for return to flipkart (Return ID: 9582841). Flipkart replaced the product and I got another new set which was switched on successfully. I configured you-tube and starts playing video. After 15-20 minutes I observed that it was started heating up to an extend such that I can not put it on my ear.   I turned off wifi/3g data/ location service etc and execute same you-tube tests. Test fails.  It was heating up. I have requested another return Return ID: 8364911  Finally I have received my final handset and I am very happy with this product.  There is no heating issue at all.   4 star for overall experience. 1 star is deducted for multiple return request.  -- Samarjit",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Considering my pretty high usage of WhatsApp and Facebook, battery still lasts for an entire day and no, phone doesn't heat up or anything when charging. Camera quality is pretty decent, memory is good too. Just had one problem with phone hanging / freezing in a week's time but that was because of an app I had downloaded, deleted the app, phone back to being awesome since that. (processor maybe)... No USB cable in the box, using my old phone's cable and no, it's not like one of those chargers where USB and charger are same/ connected, there's deff no USB cable and I have checked the box thoroughly. In the box headset is also pretty bad, doesn't fit, is ancient style, deff not cool and hurts my ears. I'm using another headset with the phone so big flop on accessories! Also had to buy the Moto flip case separately- its an awesome case to go with this phone but could have been cheaper, I get great compliments on the case and the phone both! To sum it up, if you want all the features that this phone has (on a universally known and good brand), you deff need to pay around 5-10k more than this.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,E-Cart all the way!,"I'm only going to talk about their delivery because the phone was just as described.  I live pretty much at the center of Hyderabad - near Ameerpet - which is why I think this review is important.  Flipkart does not deal with the local courier services anymore. We, as Indians, know how these couriers can be erratic and unorganized. But E-kart is a whole new thing. Apparently it is somehow associated with Flipkart - as the driver explains it - and the deliveries are made from a moving truck.  This is how it broke down for me. The truck driver calls me 2 hours before hand. He calls me again 30 mins before the delivery. Since I have some business to tend to, I tell him I'd rather pick it up. He tells me exactly where he is (he is delivering at some other address) and asks me to come there.  I show up exactly 10 mins later. I pay the money and he has a bill printer with him with which he instantly gives me the bill - just like in a regular retail store. And I have a brand new Moto G!  P.S. - The phone is awesome.

Screen Quality-its a 5 inch 720 IPS LCD screen and as usual the quality of the display panel is very good,viewing angles are good too.color reproduction is also very natural and not over saturated. Stock Android experience-The phone is running the latest version of Android.i.e.4.4.4.Kitkat.apart from the 2-3 Motorola apps,there is no bloatware.that's the main reason Motorola did not bump up the processor and the Ram.as the hardware can easily work,multi tasking is also smooth on the phone.no lags. gaming experience is also fun now because of the front dual speakers. Micro SD expansion upto 32gb another feather added in the cap. cons- Motorola could have bumped up the battery capacity upto 2300mah. The phone could be a bit more sleek.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,1 star,Worst service of Flipkart - not about this product.,"I always had high regards for Flipkart and their service. But this transaction shattered all my beliefs. When I tried ordering Moto G 2nd gen on Oct 4th, the payment was debited twice. I was not bothered too much because it had happened earlier too and normally the amount would be credited back in a couple of days or maximum one week. Even after a week passed, when I didn't get my money back, I wrote an email to the customer service and have been following up with them till date. Today when I called the Customer care, I was informed that only one order was finalised and the other order (for which the second payment was debited) was only initiated. As I didn't refer the other order number, my complaint has been kept pending for such a long time. I can't understand how I am supposed to quote an order number which I don't know. Now it is almost a month and the customer care guy coolly responds that it will be refunded by November 11th. So, I have got no other go but to pay the credit card bill and wait patiently for these people to refund my amount.  I never expected such poor service from Flipkart and mostly this would be my last transaction with Flipkart. Bye. Bye.",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

With all the excitement getting vanished i dint get any update from Flipkart or his courier partner about the progress or status of the package. On 28th i called FK customer care and giving full hope the delivery date was moved to 1st November. Dint hear anything till 1st Nov..I missed all happy moments which i thought i will enjoy with this mobile. Then i wrote mail to FK and got response saying i will get my mobile by 5th Novembr. Today 4th of November i see Mobile has been delivered on 26th October. How come FK is able to go to Past and deliver items? I dint receive my Phone and making the situation worse the status suddenly Poped up as Item delivere? Why FK is so ignorant with the delivery part? How can ur logistics can say the item has been delivered? This is first and last purchase with FK and i will suggest my friends to not to book anything with this cheating site.  Thanks for making me to wait and giving this shock of item delivered and saying item dint deliver.,0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,4 stars,Some suggestions for battery life,"I dont feel the need to write about the various Pro's that this phone has, as other members have already written about them. However, as has been rightly pointed out by many, the battery life is pathetic. Hence for that purpose, I have been experimenting about various steps that one can take to ensure satisfactory battery backup.  Three things that worked for me: 1. Turn off 3G mode and use 2G, (if you are not a 3G user).  2. Turn off Location. (I saw this as a major contributor to battery life). 3. Turn off Google Now.   Or for that matter turn off ""Google Now notifications"" only if you want to use ""OK GOOGLE"" feature.  These three turn off's have made my life easier. And my battery life increased two-fold.  Thumbs up if you find this useful and let everybody see it. Good Luck. (y)",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase
Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,3 stars,Think twice before you hit the 'buy now',"I was a fan of Motorola, been using Moto Defy XT535 and Moto Razr Droid since the time Motorola has come into the smartphone world, I recently purchased Moto G2 one for my dad's elder brother and one for my dad, after getting to know its just an evolutionary upgrade from G to G2 with minor hardware and software changes. I had seen Moto G 1st gen got to know its performance through friends and decided to take the 2nd gen for my dad, too bad the battery drains so fast even when days when absolutely no calls were made and no data transfer, i mean when WiFi and Mobile data were used occasionally.  The battery is a big disappointment according to me.  Although it has promised for the Lollipop upgrade must wait and see if it can help the battery backup on this device.  A big zero for the battery for a tier1 brand like Moto to come up with this big disappointment in Moto G 2nd Gen",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,1 star,WORST EXPERIENCE WITH FLIPKART,I have recently purchased this phone and found good prima facie. As soon as i started using this found two major issues- viz Battery back up and SD card slot. And the major issue is with the flipkart services.  I received this product right 11th day from the date of purchase in Ahmedabad town. I will assign only 0 marks for the delivery services. Furthermore When tried to convey my grievance regarding the defects of this product to flipkart executive he simply put phone on hold every time.  The battery back is not good as it does not last more than 10 hrs. The SD card slot is not working.  I do not understand why flipkart is doing such nonsense by deputing such irresponsible excutive and selling defective product.,,Verified Purchase
Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,1 star,"It's an average mobile,I received a defective product not once but thrice....","Moto g 2nd generation is an average smartphone,but flipkart has made it look very bad by delivering defective products every time.I replaced my device twice but both the times i got a defective piece.Motorola has done a bad job by selecting only flipkart as their seller.There are other e commerce sites which are very good than this flipkart.  Coming to the phone,it has many issues.The battery is very weak,The ear piece produces a cracking sound during calls,The mobile and the charger heats a lot,The mobile takes nearly 4 hrs to charge,The volume and power buttons are very loose,The ear phone provided is a piece of crap,The touch is not responsive,we can feel the issue with touch screen when we are typing a message(you can test the touch screen issue by keeping your mobile on a flat surface and then type some letters or numbers and try deleting them one by one,by continuously pressing the delete key). The available 400 mb ram falls short during multi tasking,Thinking about motorola service centers is a nightmare. The only good about this phone is that its going to get android L,nothing other than that.  I don't know whether it was my bad luck to get defective pieces thrice,or was motorola responsible to ship defective pieces or is flipkart selling us defective and rejected phones.  So think before you buy.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,1 star,Feeling cheated,"I had ordered the product on 20th October & due to Diwali holidays, flipkart gave 30th October as the expected date of delivery which is acceptable. They had shipped the product by E-com prepaid  But it is 4th November today & I still have not received my order.   I must have contacted the flipkart customer care around a dozen times & they lack commitment as well as info regarding the order placed. They are giving commitment of dates which have already passed.  I also tried to get in touch with the E-com Prepaid guys but no one answers the damn phone.  Now they have cancelled the shipment & are re-shipping the product. Hope it reaches me on time. It was meant to be a birthday gift for someone & now here I am having nothing to give as a present on the day because of flipkart & E-com Prepaid.  I am just sharing my experience with flipkart & e-com prepaid so that you can be aware about it before ordering your MOTO G.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,4 stars,Best Smartphone Under Rs 15000 Range from a Grade A Company,"Before I start to review it, I wants to say something about Flipkart's delivery service. It was a horrible and nightmarish experience, So a suggestion, if you are paying 13K, you can certainly pay another Rs 90 for a ""in-a-day"" delivery (if it's available in your pincode). Go for the fast delivery. Don't choose free delivery, it's horrible and terrifying.  Now I come to the Review of MOTO G (2nd Gen). I got this phone on 31st october 2014 morning. I'm using this device for 4 days now, so got a decent idea about this phone.  >>PROS: 1. GORILLA GLASS 3 Protection. Even Grand 2 don't have this. 2. Water Resistance coating, you can use this phone even in rain. I tested water, It's superbly Water resistant. 3. Android 4.4.4 with guaranteed update to Android L. This mean, you'll have latest android. 4. Excellent HD screen with superb brightness, you can do your work even in sunlight. Just turn the Auto Brightness On. 5. Dual Stereo front speakers are decent. 6. Camera quality is EXCELLENT. I mean it. Superb and fine Pictures are taken from Moto G's default Camera App. Even you can increase it's performance via downloading some awesome camera app from Play Store. 7. Graphic quality and GPU works very fine. Pretty decent experience with gaming and heavy HD gaming. 8. 1GB RAM is good enough for your work.  9. 16 GB Internal storage with 12.3GB of Free space! That is brilliant!  10. I really haven't tested WiFi yet, so can't tell anything about it. 11. Pure Android experience is a big plus. 12. Build quality of Moto G is one of the finest you'll find. 13. Customer care of Motorola is surprisingly awesome. Their Cust. service website's LIve Chat system is Superb! You can solve any of ur problem instantly there! It's a Big Big Help for your any Motorola smartphones.  14. Well, It covers almost all of my needs and hopefully yours also if you have a budget of under 20K. Trust me, I did a long and detailed research about smartphones of Under 20K range, and this is an excellent device to buy!  >>> CONS:: 1. Sadly, like EVERY other phone, it has some disadvantages as well, 1st of all id BATTERY. Moto G (2nd Gen) has a bettery of 2070 mAh. Battery drains out pretty fast while you use data connection little bit. while downloading, if you play games, it'll be drains out battery extremely fast. It's very Hard to keep the phone on in a single full charge for 24 Hours. Its Impossible really. Max battery can last 16-18 hours with very moderate use. If you use more than that, you have to charge atleast for a hour to keep it on. So twice charging in a day is must even in a brand new phone! But Charging to 100% don't take too long. Even you can charge it fast by buying a powerfull power bank or anything like that.  2. Quality of headphone is very poor. I suggest, buy a good headset to have a excellent music experience.  3. Moto G 2nd Gen DON""T HAVE a USB data cable to connect it with PC. So you have to buy it again. It's really sad. 4. Keep the brightness to very low to save battery. Unless its cost too much battery which you can't afford. But With this low brightness, you can do everything superbly.  Now, as you can see, Moto G has almost everything to fulfill your demand, but it lacks a strong battery power. But If you use it smartly, and there are several apps in play store to save battery life, which are quite useful, it'll last enough long to serve you. and, Go for official Moto G Shells from Flipkart, yes, it's costly, but It add a brilliant looks and suparb grips to the phone. So I strongly suggests, Use original Moto G shells, it's very very good! Final word: Thumbs Up! You can go for it!",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,Excellent phone at tjis price range..,"I purchased this phone on 4-5th day after launch... i have used phones of other major brands too, like samsung, micromax, sony,.. but i found this as best fit phone in my budget... i'm surprised to see some people commenting negative about phone, but till now i do not have any issue with this phone and it works excellent... I'll highly recommend this phone to people... This phone have much better build quality and speed as compared to any of the samsung phone upto 20k price range... this phone have great specifications and features which i'm going to mention below... Display, Processor and OS  The New Moto G (2nd gen) arrives with a 5-inch IPS multi-touch display that provides sharp visual experience with a resolution of 720 x 1,280 pixels (HD). The Corning Gorilla Glass 3 protected touch responsive display enables you to make transitions between screens, edit photos or access apps at the expense of crisp touches.  At the heart of the smartphone, you can find the same 1.2GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 400 quad-core processor functioning in combination with 1GB of RAM to deliver seamless and fast performance with anything you throw at it. It comes preloaded with the stock version of the recently launched Android v4.4.2 KitKat OS. Also in few days probably in mid of nov. 14 this phone will get android L...  Camera and Storage  The New Moto G (2nd gen) is armed with an excellent 8MP snapper at the rear end which is far better than the 5MP camera available in the outgoing model Moto G. It comes with an LED flash and accompanied by a 2MP shooter above the display.  The on board storage capacity of the smartphone is 16GB, which is further expandable by 32GB using a micro SD card.  Phone supports OTG also for accessing pendrives and other storage devices.. And works excellent...(u can get a OTG from any phone shop at 50-60 bucks)  Battery and Connectivity  The New Moto G is furnished with the regular connectivity features like 3G, dual SIM slots, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, GPS and USB port. For running the show for a decent amount of time, the smartphone relies on a 2,070mAh li-ion bbatter which runs phone approximatly for whole day. About 19-20hrs of battery backup on 2g.. I used to charge it during night and use it whole day.  Cons. Charger is poor, takes too much to charge phone... Approx 4 hrs from 5% to 100%.. Internet surfing is quite decent and smooth.  Phone supports both micro sims.  Build quality  Excellent build quality and really looks great on hands. Back is mat finish with finger print resistance and front part have gorilla glass 3 which is amazingly hard to withstand almost every harsh condition. Phone is splash resistant and repel water coming over it..  Great phone at this price range... Go for it... Have a good day..",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase
Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,Moto G........ A smart Pick,Firstly I was hesitant to go for buying Moto G2 reading some of the reviews. Later one of my friend bought him. I checked it out and the same day I ordered one. 1) Super delivery...... just 2.5 days to soon to early. 2) 8 MP is 8 MP... not like others promising 8 mp and clarity is not even 5MP 3) Battery.. 5 star to the battery. but The charger heats up. Same issue pertains with moto g and E 4) Processor is awesome. Android 4.4.4 Rocks. no issues with the ram. I even played fifa 14 in it. 5) Speakers are loud and clear. 6) Touch is awesome and royal.  Thus I conclude that Moto G2 is a superb pick keeping in mind that u are upgrading your self i.e. after using a low budget cell around 6 - 9k. Wont recommend this phone to all those who were earlier using cells arnd 25-30k. they will never like it.  Best cell at its price.,0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,2 stars,Complete Review,"Be aware of manufacturing defects: First I thank Flipkart for there excellent customer support. But, I'm not satisfied with the brand Motorola because I replaced my phone two times. 1st replacement is for defective top speaker. 2nd replacement is for not receiving latest update and a damaged pixel.  Battery: 1. After a week usage found that average screen time (phone usage time) is 5 Hours and 30 minutes only which is really terrible. 2. It will take at least 3 Hours and 40 minutes to charge from 1% to 100%. Now I feel like its again a defective piece that I got.  Accessories recommendation: 1. Noise Back Cover for Moto G (2nd Gen). 2. Do not buy cheap Tempered glass because it will affect touch sensitivity.  Design: * It feels and looks like a premium phone. * But when it comes to its physical size Moto G 1st gen feels compact. * Feels bit heavier.  Features: * Simple and beautiful launcher UI which better than Moto G 1st gen. * After updating to System version 21.11.23 we will get ""Ok Google"" support. * It is one of the few phones which will get Android L upgrade.  Performance: * Pictures taken with LED flash and artificial lighting are good. * Front camera lags always. * After installing ""clean master"" with enabled real time protection battery like is OK for normal use otherwise it is worst. But I hope it will be fixed in Android L upgrade. * It takes 3hrs to charge from 1% to 100% with the given adapter. * WiFi connectivity is not so good its almost like that we have to sit in the same room where the WiFi router is installed. * Great GPS and GLONASS connectivity(Good navigation system).",0 of 1 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,The best quality in this range compared to Mi3,"Having used moto G 1st edition and currently using this latest edition, I am a true moto loyalist! The built quality of the phone is superb. The specifications are more than sufficient for a normal user. Firstly if you use your phone a lot of phone calls and emails, I would only recommend this phone. The quality of the phone is very important. Mi3 lacks this big time. The phone does heat up eventually! Secondly moto g shape is amazing. It fits in your hand & pockets easily thanks to its design. Mi3 is straight and usually it does fall out. Mi3 has a much better screen but its not that big a factor!  Pros: Brilliant design and built quality. Very user friendly Amazing after sales service Output on headphones is superb! Doesn't hang/lag at all!! (Irrespective of ram size) Made for business use  Cons: Camera is strictly OK Not great for experimentation like if you are a developer! USB cable is not included!

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,Powerpacked Performance: All new Moto G 2nd Gen [Uniquely Restored],"Review on 12999 Spent - Built Quality: A strong body with fine edges and a sexy curve, like you are holding a beautiful girl in your hand. Screen: Bright and colorful with awesome viewing angles and a screen to fall in love with. Sound: This what I loved the most, two front facing speakers - Loud & Crisp quality. Camera: A necessary upgrade from last years Moto G, now with 8MP and a quality to be cherished and a breathtaking Slow motion video capturing. Front also serves a decent quality. Battery: Though the same size battery should be a drawback, but it serves more than what one can think. It last for more than 30 hours.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,1 star,Not so happy with the performance of the moto g ( 2nd gen),"Hello All,  I have purchased this mobile on big billion day and after a use of 2/3 week i just wanted to share fes things which may be useful for other buyers  1) The most annoyed thing for me is that the mobile gets heated up exceptionally high. You are not able to speak continiously for more than 15/20 mins. It is not bearable near your ear. so think twice before investing in this phone   The reply from flipkart to this complaint was more annoyed. As per flipkart this is normal and it is not a defect.  2) The 3.5 mm jack is not working with all the headphones. I tried with my last nokia headphones and it is not working    Again the answer for the same was more annoyed. Flipkar conveyed me that it is recommended that you should only use motoroal headset. I dont know if flipkart and motorola really had any engineers with with them to convey the meaning of standardisation. The bottom line moto g has their exclusive 3.5 mm jack and if it works with other headphones then you are really lucky  3) On playing video or recording vidieos it heats up exceptionally.   Again flipkart says it is normal..  and you will not get any replacement.   Please beware of purchasing on discount as you may get substandard mobiles",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Have bought numerous phones from them and most i had to return coz of ""grey"" market phones they are. In the bargain I have lost 7000 bucks from februaury till november 2014. Plus enough inconveniences and loss of time energy and data.  Moto G 2nd gen, is a faulty phone. Promises 1GB RAM but still most of he Apps crash mid way. Awful display, one odd day i saw all blurred display, swicthed off and then turned on then it got sorted. Happens every now and then. Volume is a complete turn off and so is the experience. Had ordered for a refund on 16th Oct and they are still ""getting back to"" me. This time I will make sure that Flipkart repays me all the money and time and energy lost in ""trusting in"" them.

Camera quality is average, After taking 10 to 12 images in normal use it is not responding as well as whole device gets hang, and warming up no it is not correct word it is heating up very high temperature. Upper area around the camera hardware. 2. Internet connectivity is also not impressive having much trouble to using 3G. 3. Loud speaker for calling is not good and notification sound+ vibration is too low. 4. Service centers are available only in big cities.  But I am 100% sure that Motorola / Google will fix this Camera and connectivity problem. UI has to be improve. I also request to flipkart that please convey this message with Motorola. I got replacement for same problem & other one. Motorola and Flipkart gives me full attention both made goodwill. I appreciate to both of these organization.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,1 star,Review from 1st time Andriod touch screen user. Used 2 handsets and Finally refund,"I am basic user with just basic internet surfing, FB, Chat & emails. 1st time used Android phone & I rarely change my cell phone so use one phone for 6-7 years. Hence do a deep review before buying any phone. So here is my review  eKart Delivery:- not so good would give them 2 out of 5; where 5 being highest.  About Phone Awesome phone, great screen size, no crap apps, super fast, people use 2 view my phone & compliment tht its awesome fast & looks great, v easy 2 use for a new Android user like me, Looks awesome frm back & gives Nexus feel. People use 2 ask me is it Nexus. due 2 its dark black screen & thin size.just loved all the compliments I received & this handset made me feel special. Updates are fast frm google-Moto  Pro:- Look & feel, light weight, slim, very fast, easy 2 use, screen display, high volume, lengthy charge, pre attached good screen guard, auto brightness does awesome task in sunlight or in dark.  Cons:- No file explorer installed, so u need 2 have internet for sure 2 download it, Fm Radio can not be played on speakers :) no big deal. Battery saver only starts once battery reaches 15%  1st Handset was having huge network breaking issues, other person was not able 2 hear me, calls getting disconnected, but was getting Awesome internet surfing speed even when network was low, never heated even while watching 3 hours of Movie, Voice frm earpiece was coming frm left side i.e when you talk on phone u can feel voice is more loud when you are listening frm left ear & its low when you are listening frm right ear. Hence in huge noisy place I had 2 use phone 2 listen frm left ear or adjust it on right ear so as 2 get more sound. Hence assuming hardware issue with sounds & network I got it Replaced.  2nd Phone:- Screen guard not placed properly. frm the way it was stuck seems like it was placed just in hurry & sems like was not a factory stuck screen guard. Also there is no logo on screen guard frm Moto, the phone is not sealed packed in plastic. so no way 2 know if its original or refurbished phone. But thts how Moto has kept its strategy. so as 2 benefit by selling even refurbished handsets as new .... hence felt like I got a refurbished handset, Voice again was coming more frm left side of handset, so thought this is how the phone was designed so ignored this prob. But started facing heating prob.. the first half of phone frm Top specially the back side area where camera is located use 2 heat a lot while using internet for one hour or using internet along with phone charging & if you receive call at same time .. u cant even touch it 2 your ear.. so have 2 remove charging listen call for couple of mins frm distance & then it use 2 cool down fast..but after charging again starts heating.. but with no use only charging it become normal. This 2nd phone use 2 take approx 6-7 hours 2 charge tht too not reaching 100%. Called customer care of Flipkart for replacement.. thy suggested refund. I loved this phone so didn't wanted refund for sure. .still opted for refund due 2 pressure frm pears. NOW Most Important .. while the refund was in progress just 2 days before pick up .. I removed the default screen guard of phone & the look of screen was just too AWESOME .. believe me its like a 3d .. super cool.. but then walking on sun light if you see the phone (non active mode in blank screen) u can see lots n lots of vertical & horizantal lines behind the glass .. looked like I can see the chips behind the screen. But thought since the screen quality is awesome hence Moto has purposely kept it like tht. Hence decided 2 cancell the refund but called Moto G customer care for 2nd opinion .. & 2 my shocker thy told me..tht the hearing prob tht the voice coming frm left side of phone is a hardware issue & needs 2 be fixed at service center & vertical lines are not normal hence the phone again needs 2 get replaced. Flipkart also confirmed tht the lines are not normal.  Considering these 2 facts tht voice coming more frm left side of phone.. which i faced on both 2 handsets & vertical lines tht I explored only in 2nd handset .. I decided 2 go for refund. Heating prob is normal in all the phones even Samsung I have seen all my friends complaining about heating issue. Also battery is just for half day with basic use.. but thts due 2 HD & bigger screen.  Conclusion:- still MotoG is the best phone 2 buy, as it has a big big brand name behind & support of Google, awesome performance & still the best comparing 2 samsung.xiomi,asus .. great after sales service, once you are done with one month support frm flipkart .. after sales service does makes a huge impact  It seems tht either Flipkart is selling refurbished handsets or MotoG quality check department is messing up all the handsets .. as receiving 2defective handsets is not common .. most of my friends using this phone are not facing any issues except me .. so its bit depressing tht I have been left with such bad experience & can not buy this awesome phone",0 of 1 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

The most frustrating experience was not being able to track the shipment. I was following up with Flipkart and the logistics company (Ecom Express) everyday and they kept giving me vague replies. Flipkart itself did not have a clue on where the shipment was and they kept telling me, ' we have escalated the issue'. God knows where they have escalated the issue. The logistics company was on a different level altogether. They told me that there was a huge backlog of orders and they cannot do anything about it.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,Nice mobile with 5 inches display but not really that good display,"I was using Samsung galaxy S3 before i purchase this mobile. Overall user experience with this mobile was good but when in comparison with S3 (I know i am not supposed compare because of it's price) display was with very low brightness and image resolution was also not good according to it's price end it's the best phone with specifications and build quality  1. Camera quality:  Primary camera on the phone is way too much good for a Moto and secondary camera is good for video calling as it supposed to. Also works well low light condition.  2. Speakers:  I found that these speakers are very good in sound production.  3. Build quality:  Phone sits well in short hands also because of it's build quality  4. Touch response:  This is the major term in every touch phone. Mobile's touch is good but when touching with nails, response is not well (S3 touch works well with wet fingers and nails).  5. Waterproof quality:  Works well in rainy season and washroom usage. Thanks to the water repellent coating (S3 is not good in under water condition)  Overall review:  This is a good phone in mid price range with promised upgrade to Lollipop.",0 of 1 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,3 stars,Watch out guys - read below!,"Moto G(2) is a good phone overall and price is pretty competitive too. But, there were some significant critical bugs/defects with either the phone handset or the android-motorola combo, and here they are:  1. USB cable is not included in package - this is a bummer!!!! 2. PC-USB connections do not work for Win XP (SP3) and Moto G. I have spent almost 3 entire days to do some R&D in techie sites, yet to implement the 9th or 10th resolution. Works fine with my other laptop with Win 8.1. Therefore, if you expand your mem slot  3. I have purchased 2 Moto G phones and 1 Moto G (2) phone in the span of 1 month from flipkart. For none of these purchases, the headphone works! This is crazy - and I have used my existing Philips, Nokia, Samsung, Micromax headphones and Moto G failed to detect the outlet and produces no sound at all.  4. For Moto G(2), a little stressed usage (4/5 apps opened together; remember - other than the usuals) just show some hiccups in the phone smoothness.  5. Motorola has kept the same display clarity as of M(1) into M(2), but the screen is 0.5'"" bigger; so if you compare the display in 1 & 2, you'd obviously find some shady pixelated display. 6. Sometimes, most weirdly, my home-screen app icons disappear, sometime I notice them sitting in another home-screen. I am pretty particular about my customized home-screens (5 years of touch-phone usage .. LOL) and this is really crazy.  7. If I recall more, I will note them down too.  Overall: It's a good budget phone with lots of usable and few rubbish extended features. But the customization of android kitkat by Motorola has been proved to be really so useless. Note: Moto G (Gen1) was perfect in terms of these strange creepy problems.",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase
Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,3 stars,Moto G series is excellent but service is not good,"I had bought Moto G phone in February 2014 and as expected it worked very well for me. I used this phone to fulfill all my requirements such as accessing my corporate, private emails, whatsapp, social media, taking long video conferencing calls, accessing my office network and receiving calls on my cellphone etc. I was very happy about the performance. Post office hours it was owned by my daughter who is very fond of watching youtube videos. it gave me very good uninterrupted video quality. In the morning I played songs directly from Gaana.com and no issues. Till September month, I was very happy with this phone. Due to my mistake I carried this phone on the beach and one wave changed my life. In a second, I was phoneless. The water has damaged my phone and for sometime until battery was alive, phone was alive but I was not able to use touch screen so was not able to receive any call. I was out of station so I did not have access to my old phone and I was also not have access to the service center. When I came back and went to the PC support which is the only service center in Pune. There is a huge rush with the Moto G related complains and somehow I managed to attract one of the customer executives and he accepted my phone in warranty and I was expecting from them what has happened to the phone and how much I have to pay if there is anything needs to be raplaced. They said I will receive a callback within 3 days. I kept waiting for the call for the whole week but did not get any call so I started calling them back. I kept them calling but they did not receive the call. Finally someone answered the call but he kept saying Hello Hello but he did not reply my query. Finally when I kept trying for one week then someone received call and asked my details and asked to pickup my repaired phone after 2 days. I was happy that my phone got repaired then I received another call after 2 days that my phone's motherboard got damaged so it needs to be replaced and it will cost me 7500. During this time there were Diwali offere going on and I lost all the offeres because I was optimistic for my phone. Motorola should improve the overall service experience. Finally I bought Moto G gen 2 because I liked phone but service experience was very bad.",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,Addicted to this device!,"I'm using the White moto g 2gen 16gb version.. Its light as a feather and Super smooth n super fast to work with. I've been using it for 2days and I'm revelling in the pure Google experience on 4.4.4 KitKat! The design is understated and classy. I'm not using any case for it and so far the white back didn't take any stains. The Matt finish of the White back masks fingerprints and looks clean. Easy to manage. There is a slight tendency for dust to accumulate at the edges of the front where the screen meets the panel. The only limiting thing is the battery. Gives me a maximum of 16hrs with moderate use and a maximum screen on time of 4 and a half hrs. Motorola Plugin earphones of the very basic variety come within the box. The camera is good (not the best one out there) and keeps the pictures looking natural. If u r a gamer, u'll just fall in love with the performance of this phone! Gives the most amazing gaming experience! Overall, its a great buy",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

I then made request to them to replace the defective charger. with new one. But contacting them several times at their customer care, they are not replacing. This is my bad experience.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,The best phone under 15K,"I had ordered the phone on Flipkart before Diwali. Although, Flipkart ruined my Diwali and messed up the timelines quoting their logistics partner as the culprit, the phone by itself is flawless. I was upgrading from a Samsung galaxy Star and was used to android. However, the experience is beyond wonderful with the new Moto G. my friend who owns a 1st gen phone had recommended Moto and I had zeroed in only after carefully considering the Zenfone5, the Samsung Mega and also a few other phones like Sony Experia Z and Lenovo and Alcatel-Lucent.   The Display is bright enough for regular use but dim enough to conserve battery when need be. The touch Screen is very responsive and so is the camera. having Motorola migrate, moving my contacts from the old phone was a breeze.  The UI with the Google now launcher is integrated on Android 4.4.2 Kitkat. The specs may not seem as high as the zenfone,but Moto have a way of optimizing the performance so they perform way better compared to other phones with slightly higher specs.  Summarizing, I would definitely recommend this phone although i would add that it takes ages for the phone to charge with the Moto provided charger and that the earphones seem too cheap but perform as expected from Moto. I would expect a more flashy/customizable pair of earphones though.",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,4 stars,Rise of Moto,"Ordered Moto G (1st Gen) in August but faced endless problems, so returned it and finally took 2nd Gen. After using 30 days i conclude:  Minus- 1. Battery (Yes, all that u have heard about battery is absolutely correct) Have to charge it minimum 2 times a day. Hoping that ANDROID L solves the issue to a bearable extent.  2. Accessories are priced as if they have included an element of gold in them.  3. If u use a high ended app for 20 minutes and return to screen, it freezes for 5 sec.  4. Screen was much better in former model.  5. 80% of your RAM is consumed in default operations  Plus-  1. Ultimate Android experience for 13000 bucks (believe me google services like map, etc cannot be enjoyed better in any other phone of this category)  2. Two mics solves the call quality issues  3. Cam has been drastically improved.  4. Screen size and icons looks way better than former model.  5. SD Card, speakers, etc are all good as specified in earlier reviews.

Sound quality: Moto G first gen. has better sound quality than second gen. both speakers are in front but for calling purpose sound in second gen. is louder than first gen .  Camera quality : Moto G (2nd gen) beats the first gen by a good margin. Pixel density in Moto G (1st gen)-324ppi and in @nd gen... 294 ppi, but it doesnt make any difference.  Design: Both are well designed but 1st gen is easy to grip and has better back finish. Volume and lock keys in second gen is not so comfortable to use as in 1st gen.  Battery: Moto G (1st gen) has enough battery capacity according to its screen size but second generation is not upto mark @2070mah... it should have 2500 mah atleast.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,4 stars,Overall review and performance,"I am writing this review after using this handset for 1.5 months.   1st of all, kudos to Flipkart for their fast service and seriously some ultra tight packing.  Now coming to the handset from Motorola.  The handset looks amazing with it's 5 inch screen and dual front speakers grille. The rear finish looks good with the 8MP Cam, Flash and Moto Logo(with a slight dip) that feels good on touch and feel. Feels good, a tad heavy, when held.  Build quality is good and sturdy.  Under the hood.  Well, I would say I am actually a bit disappointed with the specs provided. RAM configuration, Processor and Graphics all are the same as the 1st Gen handset. They should have been upgraded a bit.   The screen size has been increased, and it does consumes the battery a bit more. This is till now the biggest disappointment in this handset. I don't have any games nor heavy apps. I use watsapp and zomato apps. Without doing anything extra and lowest level of brightness, playing no games(strictly), gps settings switched off always battery back up is mere 1.5days. Think if you have much more apps and games, it will drain down the battery within less than half a day. You can watch few videos in youtube and check the battery level.  Performance: There are lags, yes. i have been facing lagging issues. It takes time to switch from apps to main screen, or even a worst experience I would say is, it hanged few times and the phone system froze. I had to restart the device.  A big improvement needs in this section if Moto wants to go ahead with this series.  Sound quality is good in the speakers, if you have a good headset/headphone, it does pretty good. Default Moto headsets provided are waste.  Display is crisp and clear. Touch is responsive but again sometimes lagging interferes.  Rear and Front CAM quality is pretty nice. Pic editing options are nice.  You can also download Google Cam app for better enhancements.   Call quality is good. Till now I didn't found any call drops.  No extra bloatware. Some good apps are pre-installed from Motorola that are helpful.   Build: 4/5 Cam: 3.5/5 Performance: 3/5 (Even though lagging issues are there) Battery backup: 2.5/5 (Should have been increased to atleast 2500 mAH from 2070) Sound: 4/5 Display: 3.5/5 Call quality: 3.5/5 UI response: 3/5  NB: I am not comparing this handset(except Moto G 1st Gen) with any other company made handset.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,4 stars,Excellent Phone for the price!,"Splendid delivery! I got it within 2 days of ordering.   Oh did I say 2 days? I meant 2 weeks. Two. Frikking. Weeks. One good thing I learned out of the countless messages I sent to Flipkart asking them what order status was that these folks respond FAST. I'm not saying the responses are particularly helpful, it's just good knowing that these people do give some damn. On to the product review..  Honestly, the only problem I found with the device was the fact that the notification light ONLY GLOWS in one color, white. This is not something that can be fixed by software modifications(sorry, rooters).  Camera quality is sweet, Well, at least in well lighted conditions. Front camera is also decent enough to show all the ugly pimples in your face. Again, in well lighted conditions.  The stock launcher is clean and fast. There's a catch though. You can't add any new pages in the homescreen. No biggie.  Battery life is average-ish.   I know a lot of people are complaining about the display and the ppi and all... but it's really not that bad. I'm not really a techno-enthusiast, i don't spend a whole lot of time comparing different phones and all, so maybe it's just me. But I really love the display.   Keyboard. Keyboard has a noticable lag sometimes while using certain applications. It does disappear after some time, so that's kewl.  The body is elegant. I mean, I'm holding this big-a** phone in my hand, and I'm telling myself I can't believe I bought it just for 13000 INR.   So final verdict. If your budget allows it, buy it.",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,4 stars,Decent not excellent,"This handset is the same as Moto G 1st gen, except for a marginally bigger screen and front sterio speakers. And of course a little better camera. I got this so that I can receive latest Android updates for a pure Android experience. Or else could have gone for other cheaper and perhaps better phones like Xiaomi Redmi 1S or even Huawei Holly. But then they have customised Android and resptricted updates. 1GB RAM instead of 1GB would have added a little more value to this handset. It doesn't lags or hangs, but almost 80-85% of RAM is always consumed in running apps and system files in the background. Battery life hasn't impressed me much. Its just an average one. But a OK OK phone actually. I am quite happy though. So, if you are looking for the purest android experience and gauranteed future updates, then go for it.",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,4 stars,Better Deal at this Range,"Hello All,  First of all Thanks to Flipkart for delivering so quick.Second, regarding the product fault dont just blame Flipkart as even they don't know what's inside the box.This is my fourth handset buying with Flipkart and the very first time was dissapointed with the delivery after using it , firstly with the brand and secondly with Flipkart as anyone would be for delivering such piece and thinking why me.I fond the product in faulty stage as one sim slot was not working but still Flipkart replaced the product with a brand new box pack,still after using 25 days, so thanks once again.When Flipkart says 30 days replacement guaranty they do.  I bought this product after doing extensive research and comparison between several brands online.  Now about the product review.I am using the product now from almost past 1 month and the review is based upon that.  PRO'S:  OS : Kitkat latest version  Display : HD.Delivered what they said.  Screen : Goriilla Glass.I used almost 15 days without any screen-guard but still couldn't find any scratch on the screen but It doesn't mean MOTO G doesn't need screen guard.  WiFi : Signal Strength is too good.I was still able to connect to my wifi router when other devices failed to coonect at that range.  Design : Feels good in hand.  Camera : Does what it says.Takes quality pictures  Speed; I didn't had issue till now opening 5-6 apps at the same time regardless of apps or games or anything.  Network : Though its a dual sim phone, till now no issues with the network or call dropping.  SIM Selection : You have an option for calling from one sim and sending messages and using data network from other sim.Even you have option for ask evrytime.But keep in mind that when you use one sim while talking or calling your other sim becomes unreachable.  Battery: It gives better performance even i use it with full performance.But still u need to charge it after heavy use of 6-7 hrs. of callings,gamings and all other stuffs.If you use it only for calling 10-12 hrs. you will get at least with some percentage left.  Sound Quality : Good whether its in call or listening songs(though dual speakers but you will not find much difference)  Moto Assist : behaves as you behave.if you are in meetings set it and will not get disturbance...if you are sleeping set it will not disturb your sleep and other options.  CON'S  Headphone : Included headphone doesn't provide what expected.Sounds are low and you barely hear or listen anything except if luckily you are alone.When i use my other headphones like samsung tab's it sounds great.But you can't expect much at this price range.  Features : If you are used to of Samsung user or any other brands you will find it with less features.It will take some time to used to all features of MOTO G and sometimes you might feel it was so easy to find in other devices.It doesnt mean it make it lesser than any other brand.  Battery : Sometimes it might disappoint you when you are really in need.So better keep charger with you all the time as backup and also try not to use so much of apps and features which are not needed.  Sim Slots : Micro Sims.If you don't have micro sim before buying or placing order please arrange it before.Or else you might have to cut you sims or have to use sim adapters which are not much of helpful.  This review is based upon 28 days of using using now.If i will come to know anything which are needed to tell, will surely update.But till now, not all but almost Motorola has delivered what they are saying.Till then, if anyone who is looking for any smartphone at this price range i would really recommend it to anyone.",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,Moto G Is the best,"its my fourth moto g in family and the first 2nd generation moto g too. no flaws as usual so same review as my previous one. but one suggestion for moto makers, in their next launch they should increase ppi density as the screen has gone bigger and infact thebbattery too. as my moto g first gen is more brighter than moto g second gen. the battery obviously will also be used up with large screen so next time more boosted juice. leave reviews buy it to experience nd u will know why this beast is still much better than many of korean poops. at last about flipkart delivery...these people surprise everytime as it was to be delivered by November 4th bt i talked on 13th october before ordering tht its for my wife on birthday so i want on or before 24th october...they just said...sir u just order nd leave rest with us...i received it on 21st october on dhanteras...rather than supporting some foreign website i support indian company and they deserve it....",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,Mind blowing phone at such a low cost,"First of all, Thanks a ton to flipkart for a lightning fast delivery.Very much satisfied with the delivery and ease of track of my product. About the MOTO G2 , I was previously using HTC ONE which was for 34K and had mind blowing features. This time my budget was low and i was looking for the same feature as HTC one . I ordered this phone i was quite nervous but after using MOTO G2 i cant find any difference between these 2. MOTO G2 is such a power packed phone for such a low price . Spending every single penny on MOTO G2 is worth. Some people are afraid of the back cover thing , but let me tell you ,it is very durable just because it looks flexible does'nt mean its cheap plastic.If opting for any other phone at this price range is waste. My verdict is to go for MoTO G2. Thank you MOTOROLA & FLIPKART :)",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,Safe & Reliable with no surprises (good or bad),"Buying a Micromax, Karbonn, Spice, Xolo, etc. is like investing in a share in stock market. Some are good, some are not, some go up, some go down, everything is a risk and full of surprises, some good, some bad.  Buying this Moto G is like investing in a Fixed Deposit. No special profits / bonus / features. But no negative surprises either. You will get what is promised; a sturdy, reliable handset.  Some things I noticed after using it for over 1 month: . Battery does take a longer time to charge  . Menu buttons are on screen so you will effectively get 4.7 to 4.8 inches of usable screen space (unless the application goes fullscreen eg. images, video, games)  . Although the online reviews say the phone does not lag, they say it after using it for 2-3 days. It does lag a little bit after I have installed some applications. But then I think most phones will lag after you have installed some applications.  . NO BLOATWARE (Hello, 'Micromad', sorry, 'Micromax' are you listening???)  . I think I believe in the policies / strategy / ideology of Motorola and hence I feel happy by using a Motorola phone which I don't think can be said about Micromax.  . Motorola phones are well thought out and take user experience into account, which Micromad, sorry again, Micromax is trying so hard to ruin.  . After considering all the specification of the competing phones, I think I ended up paying around Rs.1000 premium on this phone. But I think its worth the satisfaction & peace of mind.",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,3 stars,Dejected Thrice,"Hi Guys,  The service through flipkart is good.  But the product is not the same as described in all +Ve reviews from different sources.  I ordered Moto G2 gen with lots of expectation as it was my 1st smart phone.  But dejected not once, twice but thrice. Yes I have to replace the mobile for 3 times where all the 3 with unique issue.  The 1st one had a deformity in screen where i couldn't spot as the mobile comes with protective guard after a couple of days when i view it against the light i could spot it FK .  The 2nd piece is where 3.5mm Jack was very sensitive if i turn the earphone or any 3.5mm plug the music stops or pauses. * While playing asphalt 8 with medium graphic mode it just came out with a note the the app has unfortunately stopped.  The 3rd and the final piece was something unique:  The I couldn't add more than 2 alarm where the touch goes erratic or non responsive   Has same issues as above with games.  any video more than 5 to 10 minutes the screen turns white and whole phone hangs where the video getting saved but cannot be played. I.e the file not supported.  Flipkart was understood the issue thrice and have done their best. where they gave me options of either replacement and refund of money.   As a whole the phone's func is not up the specs. *defective pieces being regulated by WS retailer  But the flipkart is doing its best for keeping its customers. I would recommend to buy any thing in flipkart but make sure its not from WS retailer.",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,1 star,Worst Product,Flipkart did the very good job in replacement of Handset. One star is given due to Good Service from Flipkart and WS Retail. No starts for Phone.  It was not expected to have such a bad product from Motorola. On first day it was not at all connecting 3G when I inserted SIM. After about 24 hours It is not at all detecting network in any of the SIM slot. And after factory reset setting It stopped connecting wi-fi as well.  It lags on the basic functions of phone.  One more worst thing is battery is connected to the phone and cant be removed separately. Takes much more time than expected for charging and heats when you charge for more than hour.,0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase
Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,Good phone if you are not unlucky,"I am a satisfied user of first gen moto G for the last six month. The second gen of moto G also showed equal promise.Only, that probably, my piece proved to be a lemon. After two days the display started creating problem. Some areas of the screen would not respond to touches, wi-fi hotspot would work at its whim. Once, the display was gone completely for a day. I have asked for a replacement and awaiting it. I can only hope that this time it will be a good one. If it is not faulty then the phone is excellent one, just like its predecessor. Leaving the screen resolution which has been reduced a little, everything else is a little better than the first gen moto G.  EDIT 30th october: I received the replacement yesterday.By today it is also showing up with similar problems. Some areas, specially on the top portion of the screen would not respond to touches.Now I am not sure what to do, should I go for a refund or ask for 3rd replacement! Edit 8th Nov: I have decided to get refund. I will try another phone, probably nexus 5. My conclusion is that ,no phone is bad if you get the fine one. In review of every phone I see some dissatisfied customers.One can only hope that the piece he gets will be a good one. Thats why I have given the rating of 5 star, in spite of having problems. Because if those particular problems were not there it would be a wonderful phone.",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

After having a bad experience earlier with flipkart on my earlier order, this order was fulfilled perfectly well. Even the courier (Delhivery- although has quite a lot of bad reviews on flipkart and google) seemed to deliver the package perfectly well, and within the promised time frame.  The Phone: The display is brilliant, although it has a lower dpi when compared to its previous generation. The sound is good, but not brilliant. Doesn't really look like a huge 5inch phone, and fits in the pocket really well. Battery runs pretty well for a day, inspite of slightly heavy usage, and doesn't get warm/hot.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,My Personal Experience,1.The phone is well built. 2.Pure Android Experience makes it extremely fast and smooth(No Lag Or Frame drop). 3.Use of Samsung micro usb charger is advisable. 4.The sim slot is little bit hard to master put your sim in and push all the way through till you hear a double click. 5.The screen is extremely well built. 6.Impressive touch response. 7.Network speed is excellent. 8.Able to open multiple apps  9.Able to operate with one hand. 10.The volume rocker key is a little bit hard to operate. 11.Headphone sounds not so premium but considering the phone's budget it is acceptable. 12.Absence of NFC but seriously who needs one we can use wifi direct.  On the whole I would like to conclude that it is the best smartphone when compared to other smartphones in this range and it will be updated to Android 5.0(guaranteed) and it is from google what else on can ask for in this budget.So go for it and own a moto!!!,0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,4 stars,Awesome mobile!,"Recently purchased. Flipkart's online purchase experience is remarkable. Quick response and tracking is very clearly explained step by step. Also get SMS alert for each stage of delivery. While I lived in USA I used to order items from Amamzon.com and Walmart.com. I thought online purchase will not be possible in India but Flipkart is beyond my imagination related to service. Only problem I could not find everything what I need online from India through Flipkart. Hopefully they may expand within the coming few years.  Regarding MOTO- G 2nd Gen, it seems I got a very good phone for the price. For me 5 inch seems little big comparing to my iphone 4 what I used. I preferred a 4.5 in screen size because my palm is small. I liked the fatures with specification of MOTO G 2nd Gen and therefore I ordered it. I cannot give a perfect review at this time because it is too early to any thing. I will start using it all the time from next week. I have to get a new Micro SIM from the BSNL.. Temporarily I am using a cut to size SIM which I don't prefer.   However based on the features, I would like to recommend this phone for those who are looking a good, mid-range ( below 15000/= ) smart phone.  I also purchased a Motorola flip cover for the phone.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,4 stars,MOTO G,"This is my first experience with Online Purchase for Rs over 1000/-. I was not sure and had doubts in mind even when I was ordering the Phone online. To my surprise, all my fears turned out be false. In fact , it has been a very pleasant experience . I really congratulate guys at Flipkart for the excellent show. You have really changed the perception of people like me who would still prefer walking to a store to purchase the Electronic Items. The delivery was done just 3 days after the booking than the tentative date (Which, I believe was 10 days after the boolking). I believe you guys are more conservative on the delivery date.My advise is to make it more dynamic than a static one based on the purchase of the item.  Overall it is a wonderful experience and you would soon see me ordering more things on your site.",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase
Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,4 stars,Amazing phone in this range,"For this range, this is probably a great deal. There maybe other phones that are better in spec than this one, but still to me this is a better deal -   Pros: 1. Stock Android, plus this has great chances of getting updates from Google. 2. Since no UI extensions are there, if you like Android, you would love this too. 3. Nice feel of the phone. Light in weight 4. Pretty good ease of use 5. Good sound quality  Cons 1. Battery lasts a day - but I guess all smartphones do the same. 2. Its not full HD",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,3 stars,Great Phone. But Quality needs to be looked at,"I have purchased a Moto G 2nd Gen. The service from Flipkart was excellent. The phone is really kool .  But the Product Quality is a big issue. The Moto G which was delivered to me had some light showing through a minute gap on the panel. Flipkart replaced this in two days and all is well with the replaced phone.  My niece also ordered the same phone. The delivered phone had white patch on the display. Now she has asked for a replacement.  I feel that Motorola is shipping phones with defects or they are recycling phones rejected by customers and sending them to new customers. Which ever it is , Flipkart and Motorola needs to have a closer look at the quality of the phones being shipped.",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,A Solid All-Rounder !,"Got the phone on Big billion day.. Definitely one of the best phones esp in this budget..  PROS:  1.Camera Quality: ---------------------------- #A read a lot of reviews stating the camera is just good.. but for my surprise it is one of the best 8MPs..  #Even in Low-Light with Flash the noise is very low.. #Photos are stunningly vivid and crispy.. #Front cam also takes clean and bright images...good fr selfies..  #BUT the camera app is very buggy. Cant focus properly. Auto-Hdr doesnt work well.. But its not the camera's fault.. may be a software update or a diffrent app may fix them  2.Stereo Lound Speaker: ----------------- I have to elaborate on this part...What to expect and what not to.. #Expect RICH sound with good bass when placed nearby, like 1ft or 2ft.. i.e. when seeing a video or hearing songs when browsing... #Much Much better than usual MONO speakers.. you wont feel like hearing in a phone's LS.. bt as if frm a mini portable speaker #BUT dont expect super loudness. #When placed far away you wont find the stereo effect not the bass. #Lodness is surely above average but the quality degrades when we reach 75% of max volume.  To summarize.. Its awesome when placed nearby.. Nice, when placed far.. Definitely a Loud phone..  3.Call Quality -------------------- One of the LOUDEST phones i have ever used. Seriously.. Even in Noisiest streets I can hear crystal clear with my call volume set at just 60% or so... Also the voice clarity is rich..no static or call drops..  4. Display: --------------- Bright,Crispy, Beautiful. I have not used many smartphones so I dont know in comparison with S4,Note,Z or whatever.. #The display is very bright.. I drive in my bike using GPS and I never struggled even when the sun is super bright.. SO good sunlight legibility.. #Yes it is using Moto G's same display but 294 PPI is more more than enough.. no one is gona use a microscope i guess.. #The pics are super vivid and crispy guys. #The lesser the PPI the lesser load on CPU so the same battery on Moto G could handle the extra screen real-estate.  5.Battery: --------------- I am not a Gamer but I do browsing a lot. With 3G On for around 4-5hrs and 1-2 hrs of call and messaging and hearing songs in LS the phone lasted me a day. This is more than enough for me. The charger is a bit slow.  6.Design --------------- Solid build quality. No squeaks in the back panel. Phone feels sturdy at the same time light on hands. I was using a 3.7incher and was worried abt getting a 5inch fone as I have to use both hands.. All the worrys flew away when I handled this device. Light weight, rubbery back, solid on hand.. cant get better..  Yes.. sometimes I need both the hands.. esp when pulling the notification panel or typing a web address in chrome... Google has to consider and redesign them so that key tasks are accessible from bottom right area itself..  I used Nova launcher and set gestures for notification panel and sorted out things...  7.Misc ------------------------- No heating issues on 3G or in calls..No idea on gaming.A cool device. There are few software glitches and bugs which google must fix..like.. Auto brightness is not well caliberated..  Auto-rotate creates a small pause when hearing songs as if it taxes the CPU... there are tiny lags occationaly even when less apps r installed.. Maybe Lollipo will fix all of them...  We are one of the devices to taste Lollipop early.. whoo whooo...\m/  So overall a very good product.. Carefully designed.. Scores well in both looks and performance.. A definite multimedia device in this budget..  Highly recommended for those who expect Value for Money...",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

The design of phone is attractive with curvy shape. The HD display is also give smarter edge to this phone. The speed, internal memory, pre installed apps, moto alert app are awesome. For this price the phone is excellent. As you know every coin has two faces and same is also applicable here. 1. There is no data cable in the box. 2. The charger plug pin are not as Indian standard and you will face loose fitting during charging. 3.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,Observations and Personal Tests,"There are more than 3000 reviews. I am just here to share my observations...  My roomates have a zenfone 5and moto E and note 1. I have moto g2.  The 294ppi display icons still dont come close to note 1 having 285ppi. I am not talking about quality. But the edges of text are crisper on note 1. It shouldnt be though.  The same goes with zenfone5, A very close inspection tells that zenfone may have higher ppi but that is not the case too.  So i am spectical about it.  Coming to battery and charging, Using samsung and other chargers, The part near camera heats like hellll..  Sometimes, the input precision gets bad. You have to clear ram to get back to normal.  Gorilla Glass 3 claims are odd...  The moto E and moto g 2 both have a bad quality glass too than note1 having GG1. HOW IS THAT AGAIN POSSIBLE?? moto e display when pressed shows signs of display rainbows. Moto g2 doesnt... But scratch test using a small stone showed bad results for both moto phones than note1.  The battery percentage does not fall uniformly.. In a gameplay of 15 minutes. It went from 67 to 63. But in next 15 minutes of standby it went to 54.. It always happens only after gaming consumption.",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

I know the benchmarking and all. I know on bench marks it will be placed higher than moto e. But anyone just use both phone and compare moto e is noticeably faster. Its very laggy in short  2.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,1 star,Flipkart has lost it!!!!!,"This instance has by far been the worst shopping experience i have ever had with flipkart or any other site for that matter. I ordered a Moto G (order no. - OD000945876499706200)in exchange for Nokia X3 - 02 on big billion day and a day after that ordered Xiomi MI3 (Order no. - OD000948904972772200). The courier guy came to my residence on 11th October with the order and to my surprise both orders were in same package(which should not have been the case as 1 of the item was under exchange). The battery of my return item Nokia X3 - 02 was not charged as the courier guy came without calling me, so i had no time to charge the battery. He said he cannot hand me over the order without confirming the IMEI no. of the exchange item. I said ok you wait, I will charge the device. He said I cannot wait and went back without handing me the order. I told him atleast hand me over the Xiomi MI3 for which i have paid in full and that is not under any exchange. he said I cannot as both have the same tracking ID. yesterday i got a message that my order has been cancelled. I want to know who authorised the cancellation of the order. This is sheer non sense on your part. I am highly irate. I have called the customer care atleast 10 times since yesterday. I even visiting your warehouse facility in Patparganj Industrial Area last evening. They also refused to hand me over my package for which i have paid full money. They said return is marked on the order and they cannot help me. Customer care says they also cannot help. and i have to order the product again. and when i tell them at xiomi mi3 is not available. they say its your problem and you have to wait for it to be available again. Now i dont know, you guys track my order and I want the Xiomi MI3 and I am not going to wait for. If this issue is not sorted out I assure you to take it to consumer court as the product i ordered for and paid in FULL by credit card was not handed over to me.   Few things I want to know -  1. Why were 2 order clubbed under one ( when you knew 1 of them is under exchange) 2. How can you keep me from having something for which I have paid in full!! 3. Its been 12 days and I still dont have my handset. Just because of your silly mistake. I have suffered for so long.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,1 star,"Good specs, very poor call quality","Phone was delivered on time as per promised date, in spite of the Big Billion Day rush. Kudos to Flipkart on that.  Phone is very good for web-browsing, email, switching between multiple open applications.  However, it looks like I got a defective piece. If you turn up the in-call volume to about 80% (which is required to listen in even a slightly noisy environment), the voice seems to crack badly - as if the earpiece diaphragm is torn (remember listening to audio on really cheap speakers, how it feels?). Same is much more true for Loud speaker. The call volume is low, but more than that, even for call to be audible in a relatively quiet house, the volume level needs to be set to about 80-90%, and there, the voice cracks much worse. It is unbearable.   I tried various things: tried SIM cards of Airtel, Vodafone as well as Tata Docomo: all have full signal in my house, and all of them have the same issue.  Important thing to note is: it is only call quality that is so poor. If you play Music or Videos, they play fine.  Secondly, battery backup is terrible. With moderate usage, it does not last even 12-15 hours. That is in the first 1-2 days of usage (after full charge). If you browse continuously for about an hour or so, the battery will drain easily by 40%  I have raised a return request with Flipkart due to defective earpiece & loudspeaker. I am hoping to get a refund.",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase
Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,3 stars,Good but not best,Product feedback: (After using for three weeks) 1) Camera is fabulous. Its is just amazing to click photos and very convenient to record videos and click selfies. Back camera looks unsafe as it is almost at edge. Design should have been secured this flaw. 2) 16GB Internal memory makes it convenient to install as many apps as you want. 3) Other specifications did not respond negatively 4) Processor lags at times. 5) Battery lasts for one day. Battery charging is a BIG PROBLEM. It takes more time to charge to deliver what it is giving.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,3 stars,Very Good Phone with a reasonable price,Moto G (2nd Gen) is probably one of the best phone in this price range. Though its price is 3000 Rs. more than Asus zenfone 5 but its quality is way better than any phone in that range. Also it comes with out of the box kitkat 4.4.4 version with a guaranteed update for android L (now known as lollipop).   A great flaw in flipkart: Don't ever use the services of Delhivery courier facility. It is probably the worst courier facility in terms of delivery time. It took them almost 2 weeks to deliver my simple order.  Thumbs up for Google which is coming out with such great phone. Expecting Google to launch more such phone now with the advent of MOTO 360.  Thanks a lot!!!,0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase
Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,4 stars,Google Moto G Second Generation,"This Product is good.  Touch is wonderful, Worth in Price, Battery performance seems good as at least as of now in Full 3G/H+ it is giving battery backup more than 12 hours and in Wi-Fi it is even more.  Thing which disappointed me is Indian Local Languages like Gujarati isn't supported, You cannot write or you can not even read Gujarati websites in the browser, So think on this point if you used to open local websites.  Delivery took long long time + Address given to courier guy by seller was not accurate enough to track my location, He has to call me lot of time and I have to go and collect the product at some place mutually decided by Courier guy and me..

Camera is also good. but one thing bother me is that APPS do not support PROXY server of my college although chrome is supporting. It need rooting of device to install proxy apps like proxy droid. anyway very good buy at this price.",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase
Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,Best/beast in all means,I own a moto x which is comparable to my wife's moto g .. The screen is wider with 5inch .. Trust me the resolution of new moto g competes my moto x n only place where it fails is in producing colors .. Its seems faded a bit . but considering the cost its just too awesome and You can't make any difference until kept side by.. The built quality is quite excellent n not like a cheap Samsung phone plastics.. I am happy to exchange my wife's old Samsung s duos for this phone.. Thanks to flipkart for 2k cash back.. I am happy to float the laggy buggy phone .. Dont know how my wife managed to use the s duos for more than an year such a crappy phone..   Coming to battery section I see it gives a decent battery backup for 1day with screen on time of 3hours with WiFi on for at least 16hours and with browsing time 2hours n a little of gaming . I heard a lot of battery issues with moto g 2nd gen.. But it doesn't seem to be in my case..   browsing net.. I find 5inch screen is more handy for internet/games etc compared to my moto x 4.7 inch screen.. All in all the best phone with decent cost range..,0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,4 stars,BEST ! HONEST ! TRUE REVIEW !!!,"First of all thanks to flipkart for it's excellent delivery.I ordered it on the 15th of october and received it on 19th!!.I was been looking for a phone with good specs as well as durability in long run. And after searching for a month I finally decided to go for MOTO G(2nd Gen).The following are the pros and cons as well as the reality of this phone. Reality: 1.850 mb is the actual ram available 2.12.90 is the actual storage available.out of which 1gb is already occupied the pre-installed apps and system data. 2.It does have matte look which make it quite different and decent from most of 5 inch phones. 3.Charger is non-detachable.It doesn't come with data cable.  Pros: 1.A very good IPS 720p display. 2.Good quality camera.both rear and front. 3.OTG functionality.You can mount most of usb drives like pendrives,mouse and mini keyboard. 4.Dual sim.micro only. 5.Ability to play many of large apps and games. 6.Antutu rating around 18000. 7.Android 4.4.4 which can be upgraded to android L. 8.Capacitive touch 9.Clear call receiving and making. 10.Dual and louder speaker  Cons: 1.Doesn't come with pre installed file manager app. 2.Sound get distorted at high volume and sound quality both in earphone and speaker is average. 3.Sometimes sim is not detected. 4.Only high quality gamepad are recognised by OTG not any simple gamepad",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,decent phone...satisfied,all the features given in this phone are good. best phone in this price range. No such lags yet. I have been using this phone for 3 weeks now am very satisfied with it. The camera quality is not as good as sony or samsung. The pictures look real as they are and do not add extra effect as we see inexperia or samsung(have experimented on it). The secondary camera is really good no doubts about it. battery backup is fare. With rigorous use it will die out faster as is the feature with all smartphones.But with average use it lasts for a day.yes one thing i found surprising was there was no file manager application to see the contents of the extrnal card.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,3 stars,Exceptional Phone Exceptional Quality checkings.,"I ordered a Moto G 2nd gen on 6th oct, 2014 and received the same on 9th oct. I was immediately let down after first boot as the display had a blue line on its left side. other than that the phone was exceptional. hence I requested a replacement an received the replacement the next day of my request. Was happy with Flipkart CS and was happy to see the display was okay after first boot. But wen i tried to insert my sim card after initial charging there was another problem. the sim keeps coming out as it doesnt lock in the slot. was disappointed again as i cant use it as a phone but just as a media player. Both sim slot had the problem. I again requested a return. and after 2 days a sweet voice from flipkart told me she'll refund my money. I objected as it was a phone i needed. And after a lot of persuation she agreed to send a replacement. I received my third handset on 20th oct and wen i checked it also had the same problem. the sims wont lock. I'm otherwise happy with the set and i'd desperately like to keep the phone. But I'm afraid to order a replacement again as it may have worse faults. I'm really disappointed with Quality assurance of both Flipkart & Motorola. Do u think you can sell any crap to us customers? (two stars are for the prompt delivery & CS and 1 for the phone. the phone will get 2 more if i was able to insert a sim and use it as a phone)",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,4 stars,In the sweetspot but for how long,"Moto g 2nd gen provides amazing features at quite a fair price when compared to similar phones from other brands. Android 4.4.4 runs butter smooth on the device and i have faced no lags during the 1 week that iv been using the phone. The battery issue is genuine. but nothing is wrong with the battery. It only needs to calibrate to display the proper battery percentage. So a couple of complete recycles of the battery should do the trick. I drained the battery full then charged it 100% and did this two times..now i have no issues with the battery..it lasts 1 full day and still has about 25% remaining.  For the downsides..  a) it gets pretty warm near the camera while playing demanding games..even the screen gets hot while playing fruit ninja..something that also used to occur on my lumia 720.  b) The ram could have been 1.5gb...and 360 security almost always shows about 70% used..but considering the device never lags i guess the 1 gb of ram does its job.  c) i do wish the battery was removable but most phones are coming with non removable ones so that is fine.  Apart from these i really have not faced any issues with it..and its quite a delight to use the phone.  However with the likes of sony e3, lumia 730 and galaxy prime emerging into the scene i believe moto g 2nd gen faces a tough competition. It just goes to show no device can remain in the limelight for too long in this hugely advancing tech market.",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Multitasking is also very smooth -Wifi connectivity is good works nice.  Con's -Video camera is good but not great. Please put ""Image Stabilization"" in next edition.  -Battery performance is average. -Charger getting heated while doing charging. -Device also getting more heated with back covers. -Headphones are not good...Cheap and useless for me. -Data cable for is an essential need which can be fulfilled. -Some reflected lines you can clearly see in the screen on sunlight.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,A good Mid-Range Great Android Phone...,"Hello everyone ....I ordered Moto G (2 gen.) on 25th September 2014....Delivered on 29th sep 2014 evening. I was not getting any type updation (delivery status) before 29th sep. So, poor delivery service.   1. Screen: Nice,Fast, crisp and vivid, but only 720p. With Snapdragon 400, I guess 720p makes more sense than 1080p. It is 5 inches in size but feels compact and usable in single hand. 2. Performance: Android 4.4.4 comes pre-installed. Lag-free so far. Runs Riptide GP pretty well. Should run all games meant for Snapdragon 400. MS Office, Facebook and Google Drive all work fast and fine.  3. Sound: The front dual speakers are awesome. Very nice sound. None of the other Motos (E/G/X) so far had this kind of fidelity.  4. Camera: 8 MP main cam & 2 MP front. Very good snaps so far both indoors and outdoors. Got only 20 mins to experiment :) 5. Call quality: 2 mics with noise cancellation and a loud speaker! Feels good. 6. Micro SD Slot: This is the greatest inclusion. Moto G sorely missed that. Good option. 7. What else do you want? :) C'mon guys what else do you expect from a phone at this price point? It won't cook your meals or solve your financial problems. Use it practically. It's a good deal. The Moto + Google combination is working out for the masses!   Overall i can say Moto G2 phone is awesome in this Range. I am satisfied with this Phone.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,2 stars,Disappointed buying MOTO G,I just gone through the hardware ans software specifications of Moto G From internet and decided to buy without looking the product practically. No doubt the hardware of the phone is quite enough fast but Software is very very poor. Now I came to understand the failure of Mortrola and Nokia in the Market. The worst policies of the company have dropped them on the floor. In Moto G you cannot assign a different ringtone or wallpaper on different sim. You cannot set default sim to call. Every time you need to select the sim for calling. You cannot block a person from calling. If you upload a third party ringtone it does not repeat at all. It rings once only and gets mute. So many futures are quite missing if we compare with samsung. While attaching a photograph with contact you cannot crop the photo even. While display on calling photo is not being displayed properly. The worst software. I ready to return it with loss of Rs. 1000 or more.,0 of 1 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,4 stars,Good but not the best.,"Quick Points: * battery drains too fast, but this issue has been fixed after a update provided by MOTO * Phone is not very good at RAM management. *Call drop rate is too high if talking over 3g network for voice call.  * Front Cam is good for occasional selfies. *Decent display and design. * Is a decent package but not the best now.  And last but not the least...as many other customers also said that flipkart is not good at its after sales service..

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,Just awesome,I bought this phone for my dad. I was expecting one day delivery but the phone was delivered one day late despite being Flipkart First. Before giving it to my dad i used this phone for one week.  Pros 1. Battery life is very good. Even while playing asphalt 8 the percentage of battery drained was fare less. 2. It doesn't need 2 gb ram. It was very efficient while multitasking. 3. The video quality is amazing. 4. Speakers are in front.  5. Notifications are loud which is very important 6. Call quality is absolutely awesome. You don' t need to put the phone on your ear.   cons 1. As everyone I was expecting 2Gb ram. 2. Battery capacity could be more.  I will recommend you to buy this phone. This phone has more than enough features available that are enough for lot of people. One thing that I noticed is if you go to a mobile shop and ask for a moto phone (that happens nothing to laugh about) they mock moto phone. My dad was told the android is not genuine and all kind of sale pitch they could have thrown. Please don't listen to them.

Pros: - Big screen with good resolution. - camera is great - includes many google inbuilt apps - 1 gb ram is sufficient if you are not a terrific gamer - light weight - battery backup is sufficient  Cons: - Takes upto 2-3 hrs to get fully charged - Battery gets drained faster is data is on - gets i little bit of hot if used continuously for a long time  Overall i would like to say that Moto G 2nd gen is a good mobile in the price, if your budget is that much. otherwise you can get some mobiles with same features at a very low cost but those may be like china mobiles and moto g 2 is a branded phone  so those who have a good budget upto 13 k i would recommend them all to buy a moto g 2 because this is a good company phone and you can rely on it rather than buying china material like (xiomi mi3, red mi, asus).

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,1 star,MotoG(2nd Gen) hangs itself & does not work.,"I ordered this phone on flipkart's Big billion day & was delivered in few days. It worked great for 2 days. But on 3rd day it started hanging itself & becomes unusable. I tried removing 2 games to see if it was causing any issues but it did not resolve the problem. Then finally I factory reset the phone, this too did not resolve the problem of hanging. It hangs for few minutes making the phone totally unusable.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,VFM product a must buy.,"I am happy to receive the mobile from flipkart before the shipping date they initially mentioned. As I have gifted this phone to my mother I am happy it came before diwali. Flipkart is great!!! I ordered this product on big billion day with exchange offer but due to some technical glitch the price didn't reduced when during checkout, I tried 7-8 times but was unable to get the discount, however I ordered the phone and 2-3 days later i received a call from flipkart who said they apologize for the cause and provided me a discount of Rs. 1000/- due to inconvenience caused which actually make me happy.   Now regarding the phone everything is good and the quality is what you expect from 20-25K phone. The performance of the phone is good nice proportions and white color looks killer in your hands. All the specifications indicate a great product which indeed it is. The main thing is the camera which i would like to discuss as it cannot be only specified my megapixels but rather needs a description. Pros: 1. First of all the camera has a good resolution and images are less noisy if viewed on a laptop screen. 2. Great performance of camera even in low light, which I didn't expected at this price point. A great camera for indoor photographs. ( for example the camera of MOTO G2 is better than Sony Xperia L which my wife uses) 2. Colors are natural and does not gives any artificial effect and the overall result is very appealing to eyes.  Cons: 1. One minute drawback with the camera is that your hands need to be very sturdy for a perfect shot ( i guess there is no optical stabilization). As I use Nokia lumia 720 I am spoiled :) by the great camera performance which i have seen either in lumia or some high end phones like nexus (apprx. 30-35K). however one can download google camera app for a slightly better camera performance. 2. Front camera is average and not verry good.  In all I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who has a tight budget constraint (i would say best phone under Rs. 20,000/-), instead of going to category B brands MOTOROLA gives a great package which ticks all the essentials + some extras.",0 of 1 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,3 stars,Good phone at price,Since buying xiaomi mi3 is very difficult )given flipkart's inefficiency in selling it). MotoG 2nd gen is a good buy at this price. it sure has a little extra in every specification as compared to motoG1. But moto g2 sure does provide much extra at that 1k price in case.  Yes the phone with a bigger screen now feels little big when compared to motog 1. Even the speakers at front helps in case you have left the phone or bed. but the sound is not loud enough moreover sounds tend to break off sometimes.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,all you really need to know!,"(after using the phone for amonth) this smartfone has pretty much every thing that one would want in this budget.... stunning display .... perfect size , fits perfectly in your hands........ awesome camera ... although it doesn't come up with high features but the camera quality is sharp and crisp...... And as to consider processor performance and gaming , ...... the moto g 2nd gen works smooth without any lags as much of my notice and most of the games work that too on highest graphics configuration..... Also considering the battery of the phone...... it gives you decent battery life , which wont leave you much disappointed unless you have high hopes from a 13k phone.......... on medium usage it might survive for a day and on high usage the battery fades away within 10 to 12 hours or less...... also for the first 2 days i notice that the signals totally dropped in between and after a minute or two it would come back..... but later the problem got fixed by itself ......... Also .....not to forget the stereo speakers give a loud and clear performance without any noise or anything of that sort.......... Anyways in short .... if you want all the best features in a smartfone at this range.... I suggest you better go for it..!",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,4 stars,An affordable workhorse !,Hey Guys ! I ordered this phone after a long research.No need to mention the specifications and all.Yo can read it elsewhere.I have been using this phone for fifteen days now.I l list out the pros and cons which I felt. PROS : 1.Stock Android so definitely a much better interface than its peers.(not to forget a guaranteed upgrade to Android L is on the cards) 2.Very Impressive Camera 3.Decent Sound Quality 4.Good Design and Looks.  CONS : 1.Less Battery Backup 2.One GB of RAM might be a downside for the extensive gamers !!  Final Verdict : @13k its definitely a bang for the buck ! Go for it if you use your phone as a phone not a gaming device.And last but not the least you'll get some stunning selfies too thanks to a 2 MP front snapper. :) :),0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase
Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,4 stars,Good Phone at the right price,"First of all starting from boxing,it was pretty standard boxing,nothing special. The box includes a charger but the wire is not USB to micro-USB,it is simply a wall charger,so you cannot plug it into your laptop or anything. Then,there are earphones,which have nice sound quality as expected ,but its not great as you would expect,but the downside is that they are not comfortable.So,be ready to buy another pair if you want to enjoy your music,or if you already have one! Coming to the deal,the phone is absolutely worth every single penny spent. The display is sharp and good color reproduction,the front facing dual speakers also sound good.It has a built-in equalizer which works flawlessly. The voice quality of calls and active noise cancellation is also good. But the downfall,the camera!  It is where Motorola cut the prices and its fairly obvious.I won't say the camera quality is bad,but its not great.There is NOISE.Even in good lighting conditions,there is noise.I also find the shutter speed a bit slow on the default camera app, but that issue can be resolved by trying some other decent photography apps.Other than that,the camera is fine.It has good color reproduction,focus sometimes maybe a problem,but generally works fine.The slow-mo video somehow I find is laggy. Coming to the battery! Its fairly good,but neither great.Heavy usage will last you 5-7 hours on 100% charge.But for normal use,it works just perfect,it would last you through a day very easily. The phone handles almost all of the apps and intense games perfectly,with exception of OCCASIONAL lagg.I dont know how it does it,but this phone handles some games that other phones with slightly better specs dont even run. And for the part I'm most excited about,Motorola announced Android L update for Moto devices soon! To sum up,I would say if you have made your mind to buy this phone,go for it without a second thought,its the best one you could get out there for its price point,and its not even chinese!",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,4 stars,Awesome phone under 15000 price tag.,"I have been using this phone since 20days. It is a very good phone under 15K budget.  Pros: 1. 8MP Back, 2MP front camera. 2. Stereo speaker. 3. Loud & clear voice, no signal problem. 4. Full charge in 1.5 hours at max. 5. More than average battery life. Battery drops to 40% from full charge if used continuously for 4-5hours on data packet mode. But When you do not use it for netting or gaming purpose then battery backup is too good, you will hardly need to charge again on same day. Overall charging needed once a day if used efficiently. 6. OTG support.  Cons:  1. Camera quality is lesser than that of Micromax Canvas HD Plus (on my personal experience after using both the phones.) 2. No USB provided with Phone. 3. Headphone quality is not good. 4. Overheating of charger. Overall One can Buy this Phone, its really good to buy.

In the box accessories includes a charger and a earphone,but i am literally not impressed by the earphones audio quality as i use high bass earphones generally,but may be ok for most of the people.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,Moto G 2nd Gen: - worth every penny,"I ordered the white colored Moto G 2nd Gen for my brother and it was deliver in a day. Coming to the product it really offers great bang for buck. It has been almost a month and I haven't seen even a hint of any lag. It runs almost quite smooth with fluid operation, switching between apps and pages is smooth with some occasional but unnoticeable stutter. Camera is good in well lit and outdoor conditions. Display is good with sufficient clarity and good viewing angle. For moderate to mix usage battery gives a back up of around 15 hrs which is good enough in my opinion. Volumes through the speaker is loud,crisp and clear and doesn't get distorted. My only complain is that no data cable is provided with the handset and headphone is just average.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,3 stars,My Review on Moto G 2nd Generation,"I ordered this Black colour model on Oct 2nd in this website and i got this mobile on 6th october by option Cash on delivery as dussera and gandhi jayanthi are holidays and followed by the weekend. On Monday i received my package. I started using from the evening after i kept charging initially for more than 3 hours i started using it and it is big relief to me that from last 2 and half years i was using 2 mobiles for my offical and personal numbers. Now i had a dual sim moto g phone which is fit for my pocket.  Plus points of this mobile are:  1. Value for the money. You cant get better features in any branded model with this price. 2. The camera with 8 megapixel is really amazing for both pictures and videos. 3. The internal memory is 16 gb which has lot of space to store lot of applications. 4. The voice calls have a clarity and no noise difference. 5. The 5'' display and touch performance are really good.  6. The data connection and the internet browsing is good. 7. We have all the google application inbuilt in this and they are working in a good condition.  Minus points of this mobile are:  1. Battery backup for this mobile is not so accurate, if we use application's using data connection i observed the battery is discharging so fast. 2. We cant put mp3 audio songs as the ring tones. We will get some default ringtones in the mobile which we cant get one nice ring tone. 3. They are only 2 Motorola service centers in Hyderabad. 4. And in this model the battery is inbuilt with the mobile we can't remove it if we have a problem with battery we must handover the entire mobile to service center.  From last 10 days i observed these good and bad features in my mobile. If i find any interesting features i will update.  Thanks, ANIL DANDU",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,Best phone after the Xiaomi mi3,"I ordered this on a Friday night and got it the next day, so great service by flipkart. I had been looking for s good smartphone for some time and the G immediately caught my eye. The best in class at the moment is the Xiaomi MI3, which is next to impossible to get in India now, so the next bet is the Motorola moto G.  Other options:The Asus Zenfone 5 or the micromax Canvas Nitro. While the asus and nitro are good too, the nitro is a lil better than the G in terms of Specs but most probably won't get the Android L update, which is really important.  Design: The G is beautifully built with amazing feel in the hands with its curved back.It doesn't slip from your hand at all and is the best built in comparison to the moto G  UI: The moto g runs stock android 4.4.4 and I have never experienced a lag even with 6-7 apps open at once. The phone has been built to run Stock Android and doesn't lag at all offering a smooth user experience  Display:A crisp 720p HD display is quite impressive with gorilla glass, which is not offered on the Canvas Nitro. It is virtually scratch proof.  Specs: Just look at the specs given online, that should satisfy you.  Camera: It has a decent camera for the money you are paying. It doesn't offer a a camera as good as the iPhone 6, which is obvious.  Battery: Its a pretty good battery backup and i got 12-13 hours on its, with the Wifi on a times and off at other times.  Overall Verdict: It is an excellent phone and in my personal opinion better than the Micromax Canvas Nitro.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,GREAT FEEL!...PERFECTLY PRICED!....DECENT BUILD QUALITY!,"order on big billion day!..got it for 8999 for an exchange, but still 12999 is too perfect..!..i have used it for 7 days and still no problem. processing speed is good mixed with the 1 gb ram and adreno 320 graphics...front speakers covered with carbon fibre is solid for good conduction of sound(both for call and external sound)..8mp camera is decent for the price and front camera is also ok for average selfies and normal video chat...though battery is non-removable but you won't find it an issue but it gives for over 1.5 days standby with some calls backup with above 90% charge and 10-12 hrs with continuous wifi or 3g browsing, video playing and 7-8 hrs with continuous gaming..so that may be an issue for multimedia users..approx 13gb internal memory usable. I like the expandable memory feature. I also liked the 'ok google' feature of android kitkat with exciting other motorola apps like 'moto assist', 'moto migrate'(great for connecting or miracasting any other device), 'moto voice', 'moto connect'(u can use this app for the connecting device with the mobile), etc. This is a stock android phone with guranteed software update and it has almost all google apps by default..its really very useful!..the hd display is decently brighter than average midrange smartphone and u can use the mobile pretty well keeping the brightness to zero..screen is well protected by corning gorilla glass 3..touch interface is the best as well and its a bit weighty than average smartphone. Other common features of the phone is good and better in some cases than any other smartphone in this range.  there is no such negative issue for me with this mobile but i wish it could have the 'NFC' and a more battery power..something like 2300-2600 mAh..;-p  so overall i am satisfied by using this handy set and would surely recommend to any mid-range smartphone buyers...coz this the best in class set in its price!!!!",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase
Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,Value for money.,"Just received my phone last week. I'm happy with its performance and looks. 1. Screen: Nice, crisp and vivid, but only 720p. With Snapdragon 400, I guess 720p makes more sense than 1080p. It is 5 inches in size but feels compact and usable in single hand. 2. Performance: Android 4.4.4 comes pre-installed. Lag-free so far. Runs Riptide GP pretty well. Should run all games meant for Snapdragon 400. MS Office, Facebook and Google Drive all work fast and fine.  3. Sound: The front dual speakers are awesome. Very nice sound. None of the other Motos (E/G/X) so far had this kind of fidelity.  4. Camera: 8 MP main cam & 2 MP front. Very good snaps so far both indoors and outdoors. Got only 20 mins to experiment :) 5. Call quality: 2 mics with noise cancellation and a loud speaker! Feels good. 6. Micro SD Slot: This is the greatest inclusion. Moto G sorely missed that. Good option.",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,3 stars,Good but software needs some modifications,"Been using the device for a week now. I would say the battery back up is not great. The UI is too stock. They could have allowed us to add custom toggles to the quick settings. The normal switching off and on of mobile data seems to be a chore. You cannot even enable battery percent view by default in the status bar from the battery app. You need to install third party apps to overcome this and it unnecessarily takes up 30-40 MB of valuable RAM.  The multitasking control is too vigorous. If you open more than 5 apps and you move to the 6th, it reloads and clears the 5th one from the memory. This happens to the extent that it closes of music player. The music abruptly stops due to this. They could've added 1.5 GB RAM for this device, it would have improved the multitasking capabilities.  The camera UI pretty bad. When you take pictures and swipe right to view it, there is lag. Motorola needs to fix this soon.  The software is thoroughly under cooked. It just makes root such a necessity, sadly we will root warrant once it is rooted  The build quality is very good and that Moto dimple at the back, that. No cover can to justice to that. The battery temperature is constantly getting above 40C if you use 3G with location services enabled. I am sure this is a software related issue.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,1 star,Please read - Worst Product from Motorola,"I bought this product Moto G 2nd Gen as part of launch day. The phone worked perfectly fine for next 2 weeks. After that it started getting switched off frequently. I called Flipkart immediately to replace the phone, for that they took 4 days time for a technician to call me back. I got a call from Flipkart technician saying do the hard reset of the phone. After the hard reset of the phone, the phone works for one more week. Then again the same problem. Flipkart doesn't even bother to call me and check if their solution worked fine.  Flipkart reduced the cost of this phone to 8500 rupees on the big billion day.   I am pretty sure many of the customer with this phone are facing one or the other issues.   Please email me aswath08@gmail.com.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,4 stars,GREAT EXPERIENCE!!,The Moto G(2nd gen) might not be thought of as a revolutionary update but it certainly packs a punch.

It has all the features except the Google Now home screen on the left of the home screen page. Whats even better is that it comes with a guaranteed Android L Update.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,1 star,DOESN'T WORTH IT. VERY FRAGILE DISPLAY,"For the Mobile Spec, I would give a rating of 4. But the durability and quality of the phone is very poor and questionable. The phone comes with Corning Gorilla Glass 3 protection, but i do not see a Gorilla Toughness in there.  I have purchased this phone on the Big Billion Day by exchanging my Sony Xperia Arc S, which i was so much resistant to change due to the display contrast and audio quality of Sony as I love it. Finally I made up my mind and placed the order. Got the phone delivered the very next day. Got impressed with the phone bigger display and newer android version. Equipped it with Flip cover, screen guard. But the happiness did not long last. The very next day the phone slipped off my hand around 2 foot from the ground. I thought OK it is a little fall, worried about the scratch and took the phone, but surprisingly the phone top screen cracked, HOW FRAGILE IT IS!!! which cant resist a 2 foot fall in a normal surface, My XPERIA would have fallen from my hand a 100 times it never broken.  Here the worst part comes, after frustration of cracking my one day old phone without using much, contacted flipkart. They denied replacement as it is a physical damage. Contacted service center they do not have stock parts available. They have other products which they will replace the complete display and protection glass which cost around 8000 Rs (Flipkart recommended) service center. I have purchase this phone itself for 8000 after exchange. Later on surfing through the internet, came to know that lot of people has this problem with Moto G. A mobile comes with approx 13,000, at least should have better durability and quality, and should have better post purchase service. But with this phone, you don't get any of this, just a FANCY MOBILE for lesser price.  Here is my advice, 1. Purchase this phone if you love it, but keep it safe more than your child. DO NOT DROP IT EVEN ONCE. 2. There is no stock parts available for replacements. Neither Flipkart nor Motorola helps you. Unlike in US, they replace the display for free. 3. The service charges and repairs for this phone costs you more than the phone price. BEWARE.",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

I even tried skype calling from this phone and the video quality was upto my expectations. 4) The display of the phone looks nice 5) It comes with a kind of scratch guard, so u dont have to purchase one  Cons: 1) The headphones should have been in the ear type.

The new moto g 2nd gen has surly come out with the lacuna of moto g gen 1, which was lacking a good camera quality and storage space.  otherwise moto g rocks!! one cannt resist on falling in love with the mobile. Being a gal, its always cool and fashionable to carry the awesome back cover colors offered by moto g. Infact nothimng can beat the quality of original flip cover. The part is when you close the flip your phone also gets locks.. so need to lock your phone for privacy separately, your flip will do it for you. Battery life of moto g (gen 1 and 2), which was one of the major requirement of smart phone, is great and last for a day and half when charged fully.

I found that there is no setting that you can select only GSM(2g) or WCDMA(3g) mode as per your requirements.  This is the only thing that I don't like in this phone. Otherwise this phone can fulfilled all my requirements.",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase
Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,"Impressive phone for the price, Worth the money","Ordered my moto g 2nd gen on 4th October and Flipkart delivered it on 7th.   Good build quality. This phone has a real classy touch on it, the back of the phone adds a premium touch to it.  Touch is superb. The device works great till now, games like temple run 2 run smoothly, no lags. No problems with web browsing and streaming hd videos.  Doesn't heat up while playing high end games like most other phones.  Nice crisp screen but only 720p (works for me).  A decent camera, good pictures both indoors and outdoor. HDR included. Although there are not a lot of camera controls or additional features (courtesy of stock android)  The front dual stereo speakers are just awesome, they produce loud and clear sound.  Battery discharges faster on 3g but everyone knows that..   **Cons - The only thing that I would like to point out is that the charger provided with it tends to heat the device a little while charging.   Coming to the point and not talking about the specs of this phone, Moto G gen 2 is a really impressive smartphone probably the best in this price range, first time android users will simply love it.  Motorola has provided a great phone at a decent price.",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Bought this set with a lot of hope to have a set with new features. The features are very good, easy to handle. But experience on day 1 itself was not good.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,4 stars,It's definitely worth your money!,"Before I get into my review for this particular product, I have to once mention the horrible customer service experience I received from Flipkart. It was excruciating in itself but I'll not rate the product down because of that.  Now about Moto G 2nd gen, it's an excellent product, especially for its price. It's been almost 20 days now I've been using it and I hardly have anything to complain about.   Pros:  1. Very smooth interface. Thus far, I've had no lag or hanging issue. The Snapdragon 400 might be an aging tech, but it still does the job well.   2. Adreno 305 shows its capable hand here. Gaming has been great so far. I've thrown games like Asphalt 8, Fifa 14 etc and it has had no problem handling them.  3. Battery. Yes, it's a good one, at least for someone with my type of usage. After some gaming (approx 1-1.30 hours), may be few calls through the day, always on 3G (and I mean always on internet), few videos (worth an HD movie), it runs for almost 1 and half day.   4. Screen. Corning Gorilla Glass 3. I have no screen guard at present (I've never liked them) though I am thinking I'll get one, but it seems I need not worry as there have been no signs of scratching etc. I'll still get a screen guard though.  Not that Pro:  Camera: It's average. However, I don't think it's necessarily a problem. It's responsive and takes good enough snaps. I am coming from Xperia's 12 MP shooter anyway, so may be I am biased against this one.  3G signal reception: I had some problem here. It would constantly switch to Edge or 2G even if 3G signal is available. I got around it fine though by changing the setting to 3G only (just dial *#*#4636#*#*-->phone information and select WCDMA only to do that because it won't give you that option through Settings). Call clarity is good through.  Overall, it's a solid piece from Moto.",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,Good phone at this price better than redmi 1s!,"The moto g is a nice phone with large screen, good built quality and good performance. The phone performs daily tasks perfectly and the display is nice for watching movies and videos. The phone can handle games like subway surfer, minion rush, gt racing and temple run 2 smoothly and does not heat up much even after long game play. Battery backup is decent and will last for 1 day on moderate usage. The camera has been the most important update and it takes much better picture than the previous gen model. On moderate to good lighting conditions it takes decent enough pics with good colour balance. It is a value for money device at this price though many prefers xiaomi redmi 1s at lower price. But if you can afford it its much better than redmi 1s as it free internal memory around 12.7 gb which helps lot while loading big games. Also the android 5.0 update will consume much internal memory because of the changed API's so ultimately 16 gb internal memory is any day better than 8gb internal memory. Also it has stereo speakers with good enough sound for entertainment purpose and most importantly it runs stock android with no customization unlike redmi 1s which runs MIUI. Stock android has the advantage to get software upgrades faster and it uses much less ram than skinned up ui. My friend has redmi 1s and this takes up much less ram while running apps and games and does not overheat like redmi 1s.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,A Good One...,"Till Moto g 2Gen, I was a hardcore fan of Nokia Basic Model (costs about Rs.1200/-) and I used to say proudly to my friends that the Nokia basic is the best Phone ever. Over a period of time, the society and my job, needed some advance features. I am not a techie. I dont know how to use these smart phones. My two sons use and I never dared to touch them, because I am a smart phone illiterate. I tried many a times, in the phone stores to purchase, but every time, the sales men used to act smart and confuse my mind on every smart phone. At last I made an adventure through the flipkart and I clicked Moto g 2nd gen phone. Received after 4 days. Opened the pack and found....but I dont know how to use it, even switch the phone 'on'. I always feel bore with the manual. The manual makes me that it is an Intermediate maths, physics, chemistry text book kind. So, I took a deep breath and started meddling with the buttons. .........................now I am offering my review. A Very Good Phone indeed, which suits my requirements. I need a phone, my mail, skype. That's it. The price is very convincing when compared to other models. This phone could sound as much as 35000 rupees, but through online, I could get it for 13000 rupees. The battery life is about one complete day, with at least 40 above incoming and outgoing calls, 15 minutes of skype, a half an hour mail checking and watching 4 or 5 Dev Anand/Rajesh Khanna/Shammi Kapoor songs on the youtube.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,4 stars,Replacement from flipkart is good! Value for money at this price!,"Never thought motorolo would give such a bad product ..battery drains super fast when 3g is on..mobile is getting heated up with even few mins of use..video recording gets stopped abruptly after 30 to 40 secs , this happened several times (not always) but the worst part is nothing gets stored (even that 30 -40 secs of video) when this problem occurs. And again during this 30-40 secs the back of the phone and lens area are getting heated up so much.. terribly disappointed with this phone! I am going to get it replaced after testing for few more days and if the problems persists..Hope i will get a better one at least without heating problem..don't buy this low quality product..I could not return it because i bought it on billion day sale..I believe moto is under pressure due to competition and ended up with this low quality product..moto g 1 st gen was so good and this is an insult calling an upgrade to moto g..  QUESTION TO FLIPKART: I noticed that the price label and bar code on the box was tore away !!! Why ?? Are you sending used products ?? Or you dont want us customers to know something about the product price/barcode, etc?? Overall Moto G gen 2 buying experience is very bad and I hope I will get a better replacement. Please don't disappoint.   Update: 17 Oct: Flipkart gave me a replacement. Not much heating like the previous one..Camera functions properly.   Overall improvements required: 1) Motorolo should have increased the battery capacity while going for a bigger screen. 2) Brightness on the screen is not that great 3) White color is looking totally plastic..moto g first gen black gave a premium look and feel moto g2 white looks like cheap local brand build .. Motorolo could have priced it a little higher (another 1000 Rs) or so and improved on the above areas..  Update 23 Oct: There is no heating problem in the new piece and battery also quite stable. I think the two issues are interconnected and got resolved in a defect free piece that i got as replacement. Increasing the rating to 4 stars. Definitely you wont get a better phone at this price range.Could have given it 5 starts if plastic feel / look was not there and screen brightness could have been better with a higher battery capacity.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,4 stars,Value for Money,"Hi all,  First of all I'm not a smart phone pro, so writing this review truly based on my one month usage.  General: The phone looks good, not elegant. Grip is nice, thanks to rubberised back. Call quality exceptionally good, can hear every single sound. Touch is okay, however faced little issues sometimes. Pros: Display is vivid, colourful, good reproduction of natural colour. Auto brightness works perfectly and no need for manual brightness adjustment. No performance lag so far. I ran some heavy games (Iron Man3, Asphalt 8) for at least 30 mins. No issue except little heating and battery drainage. Good multitasking capability, thanks to Qualcomm. Front dual speaker gives good sound quality comparable to blue tooth speakers. LED notification. Good camera quality.  Cons: The home, back buttons are built in touch screen. Takes away workspace except gaming and watching video. Accessories quality are one of the poorest I've seen. these came in white colour however my ordered model was black. Charger is only 550mA, takes hours for charging. I doubt this headphone has output of 50dB. Cant hear a movie while in bus, train, public unless you switch to extreme treble. It gives ache in ears as you need to (hard)press fit into ears.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,Great value for the money & works well.,"Had this for a few days now. First thoughts: - I'm upgrading from a Galaxy S (the original one) which had a 800x480 4"" AMOLED screen - so the 720p screen looks fabulous & pictures look great.  - I have the battery saver on and I don't use bluetooth, so I'm getting almost 2 days of use out of it (between 2 hrs usage every day between phone, book reader, music and li'l bit of browsing). I'm sure Videos will drain it faster. - Stereo speakers are awesome; very clear and loud enough for my tastes at 60% volume setting. - Moto migrate works much better in this version than in the previous one. All my call history, SMS etc. got transferred without a problem. Note that it'll also transfer all the music & photos/videos you have on the older phone, so be prepared for a long transfer time (9GB of stuff took about 2 hrs). If you have access to a desktop, I'd recommend transfering out the media files with a data cable and deleting from the old phone before you do the migrate. It'll be much faster. - In call volume is excellent and sound is clearer. I think the noise cancellation thingy seems to work well, but that just a subjective opinion for now.  For what it costs, I think this is an excellent phone.  Caveat: My son has the first gen Moto G and it slipped from the bed & fell about 2 feet. The glass was fine, but the LCD splintered and eventually stopped displaying properly. Replacing the LCD at the official service center cost 4K - quite expensive considering the price of the phone. My Galaxy S on the other hand has fallen nearly a dozen times, sometimes from 4' high. The case has so many dents, it looks like a car fender, but the LCD works just fine.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,Really happy so far!,"Received my Moto G on the 1st of October and while I was concerned after reading a couple of reviews about receiving faulty pieces, I seem to have got a good, solid phone.  Was initially unhappy about the changes to the Moto G with the bigger screen and no increase in battery and I would have bought the old one if it was still in stock. But thankfully Motorola knew what they were doing. The 5 inch screen increases the illusion of a 'premium phone' and the battery suits my personal needs which can be moderate to heavy ( I do not play game on my phone). Stock android looks gorgeous on this screen and with guaranteed prompt updates I really can't see the need to upgrade my phone for a good couple of years. I have a roommate who got the iphone 6 and personally, the only thing I envy about his phone is the superb battery life.  The phone does take close to 4 hours to go from 0-100% battery so that is a tad annoying. The moto charger also heats up and so I've been using my samsung charger for overnight charges (because I'm paranoid). The phone gets warm with heavy use but it's nothing alarming. Decent covers for the phone are hard to come by and I'm still using it with no protective cover. I haven't dropped it so I can't really speak to how it handles bumps and drops. The camera is not as good as my Desire 500 camera in terms of use and getting shots in focus. I had to download a third party camera app to help with that. Maybe I wasn't using the built in version right but I often found it really tough to get decent snaps.   So far I'm really really happy. I'd easily recommend this phone to anyone. I know the price segment is competitive and people have their preferences for what they want in a phone. But this is a terrific phone that has no business costing this little.

A strong and sturdy look is what you feel first after handling Moto G 2. The best thing about Moto G 2 is the camera 8MP primary and 2MP secondary camera and to the surprise the secondary is quite exceptional given its specifications. Primary is worth the price. The sound is good with dual-front speakers audio would not be the problem. But when you hear it from the earphones the differentiation starts. Other thinks as screen and body are good.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,Beautiful and Powerful,"Here are the first impressions -   1. Screen: Nice, crisp and vivid, but only 720p. With Snapdragon 400, I guess 720p makes more sense than 1080p. It is 5 inches in size but feels compact and usable in single hand. 2. Performance: Android 4.4.4 comes pre-installed. Lag-free so far. Runs Riptide GP pretty well. Should run all games meant for Snapdragon 400. MS Office, Facebook and Google Drive all work fast and fine.  3. Sound: The front dual speakers are awesome. Very nice sound. None of the other Motos (E/G/X) so far had this kind of fidelity.  4. Camera: 8 MP main cam & 2 MP front. Very good snaps so far both indoors and outdoors. Got only 20 mins to experiment :) 5. Call quality: 2 mics with noise cancellation and a loud speaker! Feels good. 6. Micro SD Slot: This is the greatest inclusion. Moto G sorely missed that. Good option.",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,1 star,Worthless Piece of Plastic,"Bought Moto G (2013) back in March for my younger brother. The quality as everyone knows, flawless in that price point. Considering the same trust i bought Moto G (2014) White. The build it held was very cheap and in the night I could see the whole top bezel when the LED used to blink. It was unacceptable. Furthermore, the icons were pixelated in 5'' screen. They must have reduced the size of the icons. Though the screen maintained the sharpness but not for so long. The battery was disappointing too. Had to return it with heavy heart as Motorola was my favourite brand and it produced such inferior device. After a long conversation the Flipkart guys moulded their policies and accepted the return. Had it been black version, I might have given it a thought of keeping it. Unexpected call drops and the caller's voice could be heard in a 13*13 room, no matter you get the volume low to the lowest point. Enough said.

Color - Bought black color which is nice in looks as well as grip is better on holding if compared with white variant. But again black doesn't provide premium look than that of white. Simple if you want people to notice your phone then go with white else black. Look wise rating - White - 60% / Black - 40%  Design - Classic looks nothing fancy, rubber coated back panel provides great grip. Slim, good quality of volume and power buttons.  Volume - Call volume is very clear and great, you wont face any trouble while hearing even if you are in the public place. Two front facing loud speakers are also good but doesn't meets up to your expectations. But still better than single speaker phones.  Display - Excellent! Smooth functioning. Not a single pixel lost here and there.  Camera - Great out door/sunlight picture quality. Night - Very good flash light and picture clarity is definitely better than older moto g or other brand phones like mocromax etc.  OS - As soon as I connected my phone with wifi it asked me if you want to upgrade OS and i did immediately. Now OS is - Android v - 4.4.4 | Kernel v - 3.4.42.g668a77b  Battery Life - Phone should last very easily least 24 hours with normal use. Also charging time is also pretty fast than my older android devices.  Pros -  Excellent Display Latest Android OS and upgradable Faster experience Good Camera quality Classic looks And I agree with and copy/pest other reviewers comments on Pros.  Cons - (According to personal observations)  Charger heats allot if switch is on for more than couple of hours. Speakers - I doubt they might break quality soon if i continuously listen music on maximum volume limit. My phone got little heat up on my first charging at side of camera, but faced this only once so am not sure if its phone's problem/charger's problem or my placement of mobile was not correct while charging (placed near by my laptop fan which blows hot air)  My first product here and first review, am so very happy with this phone and service provided by flipkart. Looking forward for more and more shopping from this site..  Overall phone rating(Under this price range)(Hands on) - 9/10.",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Although I already have Moto G (1st Generation), I was curious about 2nd gen. When I took this phone in my hand It was really fabulous.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,Value for money!!!,"Having used the phone for a month, it was a great relief moving out of my Lumia phone. When my old phone broke and i was looking for a replacement, it came down to Mi3 or Moto G2. Getting an Mi3 is like winning a poker game! On the other hand ordered Moto G2 and got it the very next day.  Almost everything is good about this phone - What could improve is 1) RAM of 2G. Not much lag as of now, but still occasionally you can feel it.  2) Slightly better battery life and a detachable usb charger.  3) The flip cover is too pricey for 1700. That's now the favorite business plan of these companies to make huge money on selling accessories.",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,4 stars,The Happy Review of MotoG 2nd Gen.,"I purchased this phone on 25th Sep. and writing a review after almost 10 days.  So soon after unboxing I did the first boot and it was pretty quick and the UI was smooth as it should be. the camera is satisfactory, I'm not disappointed with it either, both the primary and the secondary.  Coming to the Battery Life, I'm pretty much happy, a whole day backup which i liked on it with an average usage putting it in wifi and texts surfing n etc. Am happy with the performance.  The Display is also good. Nothing to comment on it. its Fine. Sound...! oh yea its awesome...!  The Headphone is good i would say, you can use the sponge for that to make it comfortable on the ears and u get it for INR. 5. or 10 maximum...   The Build Quality is pretty neat in every aspect, the volume rokr and the power key are awesome.  The only place where i felt the moto or the google could have given some freedom for the user..., That the apps in the menu cant be customized. It is alphabetically arranged.  To me, I feel holding in one hand is a bit tough. may be just to me.  As i've been using the Sony Xperia V for past 1 year and which later made some troubles., I switched over to MotoG2 after a lot of research and online reviews and I'm pretty much happy with it.  The Call quality, the Display, Battery, Sound, Camera, the Quad Core processor.. Thats what you expect from a phone at this price range.  So with 1 or 2 flaws according to me... ill Rate it 4.5 out of 5...!  If you are lookin out for a budget Smart Phone with all good features packed with..., This should disappoint your needs.",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

The flip cover is waiting for replacement as the top left of it does not fit well. Coming to phone it is better phone at this price range. The cons are as usual Battery. Heating is a natural phenomenon with many of the phones and it was bearable. To keep the cost of the phone affordable the Charger, head phones are not of the quality make. Motorola instead of supplying these crappy ones should have given option to the customers to select the charger, head phones and USB cable from their quality products with specifications,keeping the cost of the phone separately. so that those who want to purchase the accessories can purchase from Motorola / other sources. I am using Nokia charger and Sony head phones which are excellent in their performance than the crappy supplied with the box item.

Other branded mobiles are having separate space for back button. This is really not good. 2. The back panel is so lose and shaking while using 3. The cameras is not having more options like, white balance, night mode and timer etc., which is really frustrating. I do not know what is the use of having 8 mega pixel camera. 4. The screen is not automatically rotating many times need to shake. 5. Not able to use the menu pad after display is off while speaking. 6. Many time other party is not able to hear my voice while calling. 7. Slow in processing speed though it is 1 GB RAM 8. Look is also like TV remote 9.

Pros:1) Great value for Money.  2) great call quality.   3) Dual Speakers are amazing.  4) 2 MP front camera.  5) Bigger Screen, Gorilla Glass  Cons: 1) the Stock Head Phone is pretty Average, but still good.  2) Battery is Inbuilt, Non removable.    And let me say ""Great service by Flipkart"" . yes, the first piece received by me has a defective 8 megapixel camera. The Images were always out of focus. I immediately made a return request on the same day. The customer service guys called me next day. i explained them regarding the faulty camera. He politely accepted for Replacement. I returned the phone to flipkart through same courier. Today i got the new Piece. The new piece is in perfect condition.",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,Value For Money : ),"I am too cautious about choosing any electronic gadget as I don't like wasting money again and again on gadgets things and buy them only to meet my needs... Done LOTS of research to select this one... Now have used it for about 10 days extensively.. I feel I need not to give technical specifications... So giving only my experiences with this phone;;  Performance- Very good, Snappy User Interface ( I preferably use NOVA launcher), No lags.. (But I am not a gaming guy) after installing 40+ apps... RAM still 220-320 Mb free. can be increased if you disable few preexisting apps (If you don't need them). No heating problem...like described in Red Mi 1s reviews  Camera- Rear too good for day to day usage.. I need it for clicking notes, newspaper cuttings.. and believe me ... pics are readable very very easily. pics are great.... Only thing I didn't like is camera software as there is no option for decreasing Photo Pixels (we can shoot only att8 MP but not 5 or 6 MP to decrease size of pic) and can shoot only HD videos (not VGA resolution) But again the problem is solved by 3rd party apps like camera 360  . Front camera,I don't need actually but found it to be more than good for video calls...   Display- Awesome for the price... but I know there are better 1080 p display fones if you can spend more...  Build Quality.. very sturdy, solid, nice design...gives premium look and feel...  Battery- Only department that didn't make me elated. Though the battery backup is not very bad and it was not expected to be great either as 2000 MAh can not be a very good support for 5 inch screen... with moderate use easily passes 12+ hours but intensive internet usage with on screen work can drain it in 8-9 hours completely... But still happy... Not much disappointing...  CALL QUALITY- SUPERB is the word.... best call volume among all fones I have used till date.... can hear someone on call with hands-free OFF and holding the fone 1-2 inch away from your ear when volume is set to the maximum..  Speakers- very Nice, double front firing speakers is a welcome change here... watching movie is a real fun with sound coming from near the screen instead of back in most of the phones (including previous Moto G)..  Overall.... More than a Nice phone at a very reasonable price... if you can spend 13K bucks I would suggest this is better than brands one is doubtful of...(i wont name but feel most of you people can guess here)..  can Go for this phone with eyes closed....  And not to forget.... Flipkart delivery as usual has been praiseworthy.. Got my fone on 2nd day after ordering...",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,Good budget phone with guaranteed Android L 5.0 upgrade.,"When i decide to change my Samsung S duos( paper weight i call it sometime's), i had only 2 mobiles in my mind 1. Moto G 2. Apple iphone 5C  I didn't want to buy Samsung, Xiaomi or Asus products.  I was really impressed when Moto G 2 was announced looking at the new add on features to existing Moto G.  I would recommend you to buy this product simply because it is awesome and flawless.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,4 stars,The coolest phone!,"Looks and build quality is awesome. Thin bezel makes the phone very stylish... High quality plastic wont feel you cheap..  Display is mediocre. Not that crisp and clear what I expected. Currently I am using Samsung Galaxy S3.  Camera is somewhat ok, but asus zenfone 5 has a better camera than this. I expected a little bit better camera in this 2nd Gen Moto G.  Hardware and software combination is very good. Very fluid UI. No lags.. 1 gb ram is enough. But I wanted stock android, but motorola added some apps like moto assist, moto secure etc, which can't be disable unless you root your device.  Battery back up is ok. You have to charge once in 24 hours if you're not a hardcore gamer. No heating issue unless you play heavy games, surf internet continuous for 1/2 hour or playing full HD videos for long time. It sometimes hit when you multitask with 5/6 app at a time.  Sound is very good. It has 2 speakers in front, and it makes good sound effect..  The coolest thing is that it will receive updates as soon as they release like nexus and android one phones..  Now decide yourself.",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase
Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,3 stars,Not as good as projected,"This product is good to have, however with the given price tag, the product could have been much better.The quality of video is good, however it is the audio quality which gives it an distinct adavantage over its nearest competitor ASUS Zenphone (thanks to the dual speaker and noise absorber) . The battery backup is average however it takes very long to charge the phone.The quality of the side buttons (power & volume) are below standard and will definitely cause a problem in the long run. People who have used superior products such as SAMSUNG Galaxy GRAND, will surely take this product with a pinch of salt.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,Moto G (The real Next Gen smart phone),"Well.. I hope everyone is so excited about this phone as I am. To start with this Moto G handset gives me an amazing experience which is equal to using a high end 30 - 40k worth Smart Phone. As ya'll know, it beats down several other phones with it's processing speed.  Summary of my 2 weeks experience: - Feather touch feel is very sensitive and excellent to use.  - Battery is up for 2 days solid, until or unless you use the so called space age technology called internet for a very long time. Reviews on phone gettng heated is just a MYTH. Every smartphone gets heated when you overuse it. So, does Moto G too, never worry about it. Solely depends on how you take care of your phone.  - Mike and the Speakers are good. It's just little loud even when it's not on speakerphone! - Gaming - Simply Awesome!! Tested with 1 GB Batman Arkham & Temple Run 2. With the 5 inches screen you'd love to play all night, any game you name it.  - 2 front speakers, beats any china/korea phone, LOL :P Treble is quite high on full volume, Sound clarity is clear with minimal volume.  - Camera clarity, In simple words, iit's a Kick-ass wiith 8 MP and front 2 MP.  - Processor - Quad-core, up to the mark. Saw a comparison video were Moto G beats Samsung S5 in processing speed. Too good!   - Widgets - I seriously couldn't find the Mobile Data On / Off widget thing??!!! Using settings everytime to turn it off.   - Moto headphones: Sucks, Could have been better. Dissatisfied. Need a change!  - Charger: Just a Charger like old times sake. Was actually looking for a Data Cable come Charger. Not that I'm complaining it's Motorola's fault for the accessories part - The buyers would expect more of technicality and advancement in this raging gadget world.  Just one thing that troubled me, while updating a software patch of around 120 MB last week in between Force Stopped it for obvious reasons which I actually shouldn't have done. Made the phone block my Internet and Outgoing/Incoming calls, Tried updating wth my wired broadband connection - didn't work or it didn't show any sort of notification while updating then after 2 - 3 days the issue got resolved by itself. Hopefully I will update in few days after my stupid broadband billing cycle thing and will use the handset for much more fruitful experiences :D :D!!

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,4 stars,Value for Money!,"The phone is quite good for the money. And no problems whatsoever with the phone so far, but I really hope that the information given on the Motorola website regarding the service centers is true and they wont give me a run around for petty things like the rest of the service centers do. The phone does lack a few things... Copying certain part of text from SMS. Copying of contact phone no directly. No edit before call option. Deleting entries of call history is not just a single click. Certain good and easy things we miss out as an ex-Sony user.",0 of 1 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,3 stars,"Decent phone, but needs more RAM","Mobile is good overall, only thing Motorola missed is 2 GB RAM, it becomes sluggish and takes a while to open apps and reach home screen.   No other complaints, about call quality, display and network, they are pretty good for this price. On battery, it charges slowly, but retains the charge well, so can't complain about it.",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase
Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,3 stars,Great Phone but,"Great service by Flipkart. My product was delivered within 5 days even though expected time was 15 days.  This is great phone for the price. I agree with most of the pros listed by others, so I will just list here some of cons experienced by me -  1. It is has gorilla glass 3 so it should not get scratched easily but under normal usage within 3 days my phone has developed very small scratches which can't be seen easily but if you look very carefully they are there and they can't be ignored once you have seen them. The confusing thing is that my moto e which was purchased just few days before this one hasn't shown any scratches so far with similar usage even though it has same protection. So I would recommend some screen guard. Unfortunately for me Flipkart does not deliver any screen guard to my area and they are also not available in market. 2. It has stereo speakers which are great but on full volume the speakers don't sound that great while listening music. 3. Camera is ok. 4. It gets heated upto 46 degree Celsius after heavy gaming and believe me you wont be able to take any calls at that temp. But it does not get heated that easily as mentioned by some users here and it does get normal within few minutes of killing those heavy game and turning off screen  5. It sometimes lags a little while playing games like subway surfers even when there are no apps running in background.  6. On screen time for me was around 6-7 hrs (2g and location turned on and brightness on auto). Battery saver apps are recommended   I will now list some pros of having a moto phone 1. There is no bloatware on phone 2. Most of motorola apps are listed on playstore and they are not included in system updates so they can be updated according to ones need. 3. Motorola gives timely updates. Just few days ago (28/29.9.14) motorola released a new update. Android L is also expected as soon as google releases it  I definitely would recommend this phone if you can find some good protection for screen",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,2 stars,"Heating problem is too much. Rest everything is good. Flipkart, I am happy with your service but very disappointed with the piece I received.","First of all Thanks to Flipkart for such a good service. I ordered this mobile on 26th Sept and received it on 27th Sept.  Moto G2... this phone is HOT... yup very hoooot.  1st Day Experience: It became hot at rear camera after 5 minutes usage. Not able to hold it even. Camera clarity disappointed.  2nd Day Experience: Downloaded few apps(VLC, whatsApp, Flash light, subway surf, temple run) Took 3 snaps. Again heating problem at rear camera. Not able to hold it.  3rd Day Experience: No File manager exist inbuilt so downloaded File Manager App. Copied 800mb movie & 150mb song(both HD clarity) Both haven't run with inbuilt app. Used VLC to play them. Noticed a lag while running 800mb file movie. No lag with 150mb file. After 10 mins usage of Wifi & playing 10 mins video phone became hot again.  Today's(4th Day) Experience: Heating problem is same, it becomes very hot at rear camera after 10 mins usage. Surprisingly Pics quality increased, both rear & front cams giving good clarity pics.  Heating Heating Heating... No USB cable provided. Headphones are normal, not in-ear, quality is average. No File Manager & Menu button provided inbuilt.(Can't do multiple deletions or selection) Two speakers, but Stereo speakers, sound is OK. No secondary mic, no noice control, pic & video clarity is just OK. Inbuilt battery(for me I am normal user so Satisfied) Except the above 5"" inch screen is very cool..  good clarity, good touch, good design, good memory,  kitkat, 8MP + 2MP Camera, good browsing experience,  gaming experience is very satisfied,  I dont recommend this coz what is the use of having so many features... heating problem is irritating & burning my hand after every 10 - 15 mins usage.",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,Awesome budget smartphone,"Using this phone from 10 days, best android in this budget. Camera- Rare camera quality is impressive whereas about front camera i would say satisfactory performance but not the best, in low light you cant get good pictures which mahey be a disadvantage when you want to do video calling after evening in low light. Battery- Not very much satisfied with battery, Motorola has to increase battery capacity. I can hardly use this phone for 5-6 hours when i use internet & games on cell. Display- This 5 inches display 720 X 1280 pixels is awesome, I can watch HD videos properly. Processor & RAM- Snapdragon 1.2 Ghz Qualcomm Quad Core Processor performance is quite impressive i would say I don't have any lagging problem till the date, even though 1 GB RAM is provided but only around 380-390 MB is free for user rest of the RAM is used by system itself.  Some more points has to be noted about this phone are: - Motorola has promised to give Android L upgrade for Moto G2. - Battery is removable so it is problematic if ur phone hangs someday. - Corning Gorilla Glass 3 - External memory card supported upto 32 GB which is again good feature.  So the final conclusion is, If your budget is tight then this is the best phone to buy if you are ready to use the phone with non removable battery. Other than that there is no majot problem with this phone. I am happy with my decision that i took this phone,",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,1 star,Please process a refund! Not satisfied with the product,"I have always been a huge fan of Flipkart's promptness in anything and everything they do. After making a few purchases a couple of years back, I was so satisfied and overwhelmed with Flipkart's service that I had spread the word to a lot of my friends and colleagues that quite a few on them are now avid buyers who buy something or the other almost every other week.   All this said, I had purchased a Moto G 2nd Gen on Sep 6th and got it delivered on Sep 9th. Right from day one, I realized that there was a problem in getting the notification bar to slide down. It was so erratic and inconsistent that it would just not come down however much you tried to swipe. Then I realized that this touch sensitivity issue was there in the number pad as well when i tried to dial in some new numbers that are no in my contact list, it would just not work. To overcome this, I'd either have to lock it and unlock it or if that also didn't work, perform a restart. Within one week of using it, I became so frustrated that I booked a return and requested for a replacement. But even after a week, It was still showing as under processing and after a couple of calls to the customer care, finally someone called me back just to inform me that my return request had been rejected by the vendor and that I should try performing a factory reset to see if that resolved my problem. I'd have appreciated that if Flipkart understood that it was quite a lot of pain to move all the contacts from my previous phone(a normal 2 G phone which had a normal SIM card). This Moto device uses a micro SIM and so I have had to manually key in more than 300 contacts. Despite that, I have still tried performing a factory reset and it still has not fixed my problem. I don't know what else to do now since I had not expected this kind of a service from Flipkart even in my wildest dreams. I still have about 5 days to go before I go out of the return policy period of 30 days. Flipkart.. please help me in getting this dispute resolved.",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,4 stars,Better in some aspects and bad in some other,"I own the first generation Moto G too and I was excited to buy this one. But I was only satisfied to some extent with this phone. I will make it simple by listing pros and cons.  Pros:  1. Extendable memory 2. Improvement in camera both front and rear 3. Lower price than the first generation 4. Performance is awesome  Cons:  1. Display is not as good as the first generation. Viewing angles are bad 2. Sound is poor despite of dual speaker presence. In fact, it's far better in the first generation 3. Phone is big, there was no need to increase the screen size 4. Battery capacity should have been increased considering the display size 5. Still no speakerphone support for FMRADIO without external app  Since the first generation phone isn't available any more, we got no option except buying this. I would prefer the first generation if they sell it separately. But overall, this is a great phone at this price range with few issues. Don't compare this phone with any other China phones. This is a Motorola phone and should be compared only with the likes of Samsung and Sony. Hope this helps!!",0 of 1 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,4 stars,Nice Phone but....,"1. Nice mid range phone this mobile is.  2. Great Specs (if they are to be considered).  3.Well I have used both Moto G and Moto G(2nd gen),so if they are to be compared then   Moto G was far more better than the later because:   a)The battery was of 2070maH on both the mobiles but as the screen size of Moto   G2 is bigger,then it is obvious that the battery will drain earlier. Battery should   have had been upgraded.   b) The phone hangs quite a lot than its previous version(maybe again the reason is   the screen size).   c)Phone gets hot really fast even after medium usage and if we have plugged the   charger in the phone and simultaneously using the phone does not help in   charging,rather it goes down.  4) I played Real Racing 3,Dead Trigger 2,Asphalt 8 and many other heavy games on both the devices and can say both were equally good but the battery drained in G2 far more faster than Moto G.  5) I hope the battery issue is sorted with the release of Android L.  6) But whatsoever in this price you can't get anything better except the Xiaomi but that phone too has some major issues(Read Rajiv Makhni's article in Brunch) that's why Moto G2 is better for me than any other Chinese phone in this range plus you get pure Google android support and a promise of Android L.  7) 4 Stars for this phone with battery issues and some hang problems otherwise 10/5.",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,Good phone,"Hello flipkart, Nice delivery as always. Got sealed phone this time packing was awesome. Now coming to phone. 1. First impression the display is very good i was impressed with its 5 inch.It is good but little big to hold some times. 2. Camera quality is good with the price tag with its rear camera is awesme while using it in day time.Front camera i would rate 3.5 out of 5 still good. 3.Phones works good with out any lag. I had installed many application made my phone storage to 10.2 gb but still phone works quite well it doesnt get stuck. 4.Now coming to gaming its good plays all games well, but it gets stuck while playing subway board while its starts but after that it runs smoothly. 5. still yet no heating issue and nice thing is that the battery back up is good, I used my phone daily for 12 hrs on 3g still left with 23% of charging. 6. Hd videos are good but some times my youtube gets stuck might be because of network or internet connection. Other wise its gr8. Videos r crispy clear 720p is good but would be better if it had 1080p.  7. multitasking is also good,Nice thing about phone is that u can store some apps at sd card. U guys wont believe me i kept my phone in a mug for 2 minutes and it works brilliantly so its water resistence too.  So all round i would say a good phone with a good price.But little changes in phone would make it a monopoly in that price bracket.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,4 stars,Say Hello to this Moto,"I purchased this product on the day it was released, thus used this device for around 20 odd days. I want to keep this review short n crisp, You all know about specs of this phone and it just pitches the same way on hand as its on Paper(Full marks). Display,Camera(Front and back),Processing,gaming... everything is classic. No lag i observed so far. The only disadvantage i observed is the battery life, you have to charge it daily(average users). At night, if its showing battery as 5%, it will get switched off till morning which usually didn't happen with other phones. So, moto has to do something in this regard, you have to carry charger i you forgot to charge it anyday.(that sucks). Rest All is Well.  I became fan of Moto Assist and Moto Alert Apps of this device, with the help of Assist, device can automatically go in hands free mode and responds nicely to your voice as well. Hoping, if there is any alternative/nother way to boost the battery from Moto/Flipkart to their Users, it will be a 6 Star rater.",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

[BUT I TRUST FK THAT THEY WILL IMPROVE THIS BECAUSE DUE TO THIS i HAVE FACED PROFESSIONAL LOSS]  I really liked moto g that is why when FK was not able to send me replaced product for the second time theY refund my cash :) and I purchased Moto G (2).   On Moto G 2 - screen size is ideal, camera very good , very decent, light weight, water resistant , upgradable to upcoming android L, display is fine and more over why every time I go for this is it's DURABILITY and solid build.  sensitive build andriod won't last for long time but I am pretty sure this will.   Though I am facing few issues with Moto G 2 like - while on call if the volume level is 75% then it gives me the 25% level sound and suddenly it increases.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,4 stars,Could Have Been Better,"Its been 2 days with Moto g 2nd Gen .Following are some of my observations. Pros: 1)Beautiful Look. It looks awesome with that matte finish. Smooth and Slightly curvy.(I went for black color ). 2)Super smooth touch screen.  3)Nice Crisp display.  4) All the apps (more than 20 apps apart from inbuilt one) running smooth. 5) Call quality is good. ( though some people complained about it.) 6) Good Quality Cams ( though front cam is 2mp . Picture quality seems high).   Cons; You will defiantly hate its Battery. Slow on charging. You will at least need to change twice a day is you are using lot of Internet.  Speaker, despite of having 2 speaker , They aren't loud. But definitely they are good quality.  Finally if you are using less internet or have time for charging twice a day. This phone is for you.   Else you can go for Micromax Canvas Nitor.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,4 stars,Great product with tolerable glitches.,"There seems to be some problem with the flash/torchlight driver when multiple applications (camscanner, camera, torchlight) try to use it. The light just wouldn't go off even after switching off the phone (solvable). It comes with a single piece charger and without a USB cable.  Apart from that, it's a great phone to hold (it's good that Motorola didn't widen the handset too much) and the look is decent. Runs on stock android, so you get near Nexus feel at a much cheaper price. One of the best buys in this price range.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,4 stars,Good phone for this price!,I've used it for 3 days now and its been a great experience so far!here are important things you must know before buying!   1.The battery life is amazing it lats for a day or so without 3G usage.  2.Camera is really good although the phones battery drains rapidly with prolonged usage and it tends to heat up.  3.Even after having two front facing speakers the sound quality is not that great and its the same even if you use headsets you have to play songs in full volume.  4.The picture quality is very good and lively!

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,3 stars,Moto G - Good experience apart from Display and Flipkart Service,"After going through all the review on flipkart I decided to buy the 16GB black version. The phone was delivered within 21 hours. Hats off to the delivery service.  But I was in the office when the phone was delivered at home and was dying to see the damn thing.  Rushed to home opened the box in a hurry ( but carefully - you might never know when will you might need all the packaging in case of return ). First glance - Aha Good (Umm the speakers look bit odd, but I can manage).  I place my sim card in the slot and switch on the phone. All the setup is smooth. Ready to go. I do a high level overview. Good Experience.  Next I open the pre installed chrome.... Wait .. Hold On.. I can see the white colour has a tinge of yellowish or creamish shade. So I try to take the brighness to highest level... Umm no still not satisfied... seems some thing is wrong. I try to transfer one image which has lot of white color in background from Canvas HD to Moto G2.. I can stil see the white colour has yellowish shade. Well I start to think whether it is a problem with this model or only my handset. I google to see if this is an issue but no success. I cant find anything peculier. Next I recall that my friend also has purchased Moto G2 just couple of days before me. I track him down and compare the phones side by side.  Whoaaa.. his phone shows same image as bright and crisp, compared to the image on my phone which is pale in colour. He opines that there is a problem with phone for sure.   I log into to flipkart and request a return on 27 Sep 9:00 PM. I recieve an email that the tech team will contact you by 28 sept 8:00 PM..I wait for the team to contact me. But a rude shock .. I recieve message on 28 Sep right at 7:59 PM that the team is busy and you will be contacted on 30 Sep by 5:00 PM. I AM STILL WAITING. HOPE THEY CALL UP THIS TIME..  Final Verdict - Well apart from display issue and flipkart sevice.. the phone is well built and pure value for money.   Hope the review helps.   Folks out there please let me know if any one has faced same display issue.  Flipkart Team - Guys I have been a regular buyer with you from past 2-3 years and have suggested your site to numerous relatives and friends. I was impressed by your service until now!!!...

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,4 stars,Great Packaging and awesome phone experience,"I ordered Moto G 2nd Gen from Flipkart and I must admit, I am very happy with the entire experience so far.  # Flipkart Experience  ## Placing order on Flipkart and receiving the product at my door steep was flawless. In fact, Flipkart delivered the product a day before its deadline.   ## The packaging was awesome. No complaints whatsoever.  # Moto G Experience  ## First impression - it's a piece of art! This is one of the most well-built phones I have ever seen. It's water resistant and has Gorilla Glass 3 - which means, it can withstand accidental spills of water and unintended scratches in your tight jeans.  The back of the phone has a velvety plastic. It feels premium and is easier to grip.  The phone looks really cool and the small Moto Dimple makes it easy to hold the phone.  The only complaint: The top and the bottom of the phone looks identical, fooling me to hold it upside down sometimes.  I would have preferred the volume rockers on the left side.  ## I had an old Samsung Galaxy phone from which I migrated all my data to the new device and the process was effortless. The Motorola app does a great job in data migration.  ## Since the phone ships more or less stock Android, this device is likely to receive updates before the other high-end phones with custom ROMs. In fact, I received an update on the very second day.  ## The touch interface is very responsive and the UI is very intuitive. Although it packs only 1GB RAM, it doesn't lag in performance. Having said that, this phone isn't particularly made for heavy gaming.  ## Activating Google Now with 'Ok Google' phrase is a hit or a miss. I hope they fix it during its future updates.  ## Addition of a Micro SD card slot is a well needed upgrade from its previous generation.  ## Camera quality is Okay. It's not mind-blowing. But, it does its job.  ## I recommend installing the camera app of Google since the default Moto Camera App doesn't have a timer.  Do I recommend this phone? ABSOLUTELY! This is a near perfect combination of performance and style. I preferred Moto G over Asus Zenfone 5 simply because I don't wanna feel like having a brick on my palm. And, the build quality is better. Also, Stock Android gets more frequent updates.",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,4 stars,From a Windows Phone User,"I bought the Moto G 2nd Gen as a back up phone. Since my beloved Nokia Lumia 925's had gone for repair and they said it'll take 2 weeks to get the spare. I needed a backup phone. I shortlisted Lumia 630, Moto G2, iPhone 4s. They are all different OSes.   I decided to buy the Android phone because it had good specs, big screen and app store.   Pros: 1. 5"" display and Corning Glass 2. Stereo speakers ( I listen to music a lot) 3. No bullshit apps just plain vanilla Android 4. 16GB onboard (unlike the first Moto G) 5. LED notification 6. Android's versatility 7. SlowMo video function  Cons: 1. Crappy camera. Even the cheapest Lumia has a decent camera. 2. A little slow at times 3. Android has 1-2 extra steps to find things 4. No double tap on the screen to unlock,even the Rs.7000 Lumia 520 has it. 5. Social networking is not integrated into the OS.  6. Biggest issue. Moto doesnt sync with Facebook contacts. It's a known issue on their site. Amazing how nobody mentions this. What a pain! 7. Battery takes forever to charge 8. Custom launchers slow down the phone and involve a learning curve 9. Gmail doesnt have a filter to see just the unread msgs like in WP8 10. Every stupid action has a notification 11. There is no separate volume control for Notifications and media 12. So many bugs with the interface design, like overlaps, etc.  13. Found swipe to be inaccurate. 5/10 times Prefer it on WP8 14. I miss Bing wallpaper bigtime! 15. Heavy and bulky  Overall I sometimes wonder if it is worth Rs.12999. I'd say it's worth Rs.9999.  Anyways this is just a backup phone until my awesome Nokia Lumia 925 comes home.  Hope this helps someone.",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,Awesome Phone for a Superb Price!!,"I bought this phone on the day the Phone launched, however, wanted to thoroughly test the phone before posting any comments.  Firstly, the phone lives up to its expectations. The 5""screen is pretty decent and the Stereo speakers are cool. Gives you a whole different experience while playing games or listening to music. The expandable SD Card option is a Plus point, however, I''m not sure if we can move the apps to it.  This is a really good mid-level phone with good specs available on a budjet price.  To those complaining about poor battery, I would suggest them to buy a Nokia phone with BL-5C Battery. This is an android device and is obviously power hungry, given its screen size. I have also been using a Nexus 5 over an year now and even that doesn't last for day with Normal internet browsing and Gaming...  Overall, the experience has been satisfactory..

CONS #It lags if internet is used for long,(chrome) try using opera.  #Cannot handle more then 5 major apps (low multitask) this maybe due to the fact that it has 1GB RAM  MAJOR CON I faced is that there is no sound sometimes when calling or receiving calls....this can be temporarily removed by restarting the phone and this is not a permanent solution. i exchanged this phone once but the problem still persists though quite less in the new one.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,"I think the title is okay, but a bit long. Moto G2 sounds & looks smarter1","I think the Moto G (2nd Gen) is a superb phone. I was using the Moto G(8gb) before this & I loved it, but the memory was little less. So when the Moto G (2nd Gen) was launched I lost no time in selling my Moto G and ordering the New model. And believe me it was worth the 4k odd that I lost in the transaction. My previous model was black in colour so I got the white one this time, but I think the black looks better. Regarding the performance of the set, I've used other popular brands Android Smartphones, but the touch & performance of the Moto G is a class apart. One thing though, I love the Android Kit Kat for all the Apps & Net use, but for using the phone AS a phone the Windows 8.1 is much more user friendly OS. (I'm using a Lumia 720 ((Windows 8.1) I've got the best of both worlds! My Lumia for calls/sms & my Moto G for everything else!! NB. Flipkart's service was excellent as usual, BUT! The packing was not as good as 1st time! The bubble wrap was Not as thick as the previous time & the phone box was rattling in the outer carton. But fortunately the phone arrived safe & sound.",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Battery consumption is also low. at least lasts me more than a day with data on and wifi when i get back home. multi tasking is a breeze and no lag whatsoever within tasks.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,Go for it,"I purchased this phone as a gift to my mom on the very first day of its launch. I was uncertain first to buy a phone which had no reviews but I went with the reputation Moto had for their first version of this phone. And I am happy that my decision was indeed not a bad one. The phone works really well out of the box. Not only that, I loved the camera and sounds on this one. Couldn't believe that a phone with such specs and quality could be for bought for 13k. To anyone on the fence just go for it.   I like to mention that flipkart had few offers to first day buyers like me but they are sending details to the offer late than they promised. And I am still waiting on the results for the luckydraw which was suppose to be held on 25th and its 27th yet nothing from Flipkart. Still I can't take off any stars from my review due to flipkart's service since the phone deserves 5 stars. And the rating is only for the phone.  I also got the flip cover for 850 bucks with the offer applied which still felt expensive for a cover. The original price of the cover is 1700 which is insane for people who are going to buy this phone now.   All in all Phone is great. Cover bit expensive and flipkart not totally up to their promises but getting there.",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase
Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,Amazing Smartphone Phone,"Thanks Flipkart..!! I have been waiting for Moto G when its first stock was over. As the saying waiting is always sweet been implemented on me. Now I am blessed with Moto G 2nd Generation. Its been a long story today how owe this amazing phone. I was using the Nokia E5 which I purchased in my college time and it has been 6 years since I have that phone. All of friends are using smartphones of different manufactures but I had that Nokia E5 and everybody told me that I should purchase a new smartphone of any brand. I waited a long for such a smartphone which is economical and sound good in technical specification. Then I found Moto G but at that time I don't have the money to buy the phone, not even on EMI because I need to support financially my parents. Even they told me to purchase a new phone but I never did instead I browse Flipkart just to have a look on Moto G which I always said to me that one day you will be mine. But unfortunately it never did. I asked lot of people to help me purchasing the Moto G but nobody helped me out. Even when there was an offer for an exchange of old phone to get a discount on Moto X, at that moment I was unable to purchase Moto X. Although its beyond my budget but I thought for a one time investment but again bad luck nobody helped me out in purchasing that amazing Moto X even on EMI. When there was a offer for the last stock of Moto G with a discount of Rs. 1,999 even then nobody helped me out. I waited and waited to someone who will help me in getting this phone but at the end the stock finishes. I really was very depressed and angry with all those people whom I seeked helped and they intend to be my friends and earning in thousands in a month. I was talking to nobody nor replying on chats. Then one day my uncle called me and asaid he own a Moto G and if I want he can give me but I refused the offer and thank him to understand my attachment with Moto G. Even I put my email for the notification for the new arrival of Moto G but I never received any mail from Flipkart. I thought I might put the wrong email address and checked the Flipkart website on regular basis but again the hard luck it was not available with the new stock of Moto G. One day I get to kow that Moto G 2nd generation is coming very soon and prepare myself to purchase this amazing phone only on it launch day. I tried calling each and every friend of mine but nobody helped me out even those people who own a credit card with a good credit limit they refused. Anyhow amazingly the same day on the launch of Moto G 2nd Generation my uncle gave me a call in the evening and provided me his credit card details and asked me to purchase my dream, first smartphone of my life Moto G 2nd Generation. I cant tell you how I waited just to see the phone and each and every second till the date of delivery of first ever smartphone of my life I waited for my door bell to ring and someone will give me my love, my phone to me. I cant express my emotions, my tears, my happiness, my goosebumps in this text but I am really thankful to Flipkart and Motorola to gain launch this phone for me. Even while writing this review I am crying with happiness. Thank you once again. !! I love my phone my own phone which nobody gifted to me. Thank you God for listening to my request.",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase
Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,3 stars,Did not meet expectations:(,"i bought this phone after a lot of research in the market about budget smart phone between 10-15K.And there was so much hullabuloo about Moto G2 so i ordered it on Flipkrt.Thanx flipkart for their timely delivery of the product.You guys rock!!!.  I had so much expectations from this phone since people consider it as market Leader in budget smart phone category.But when i started using it ,i found some things unusual: 1.It's charger gets heated after a certain time. 2.Earphone of motoG sucks so i use sony's.Thank god i had those!!! 3.UI experience not impressive.There are very less shortcuts for Apps.so every time you have to go to settings. 4.And one major flaw that i found,i don't know if i am facing this problem only,the internet speed sucks on this phone.I was using Xperia M before this,and under regular Idead 2G plan,internet speed like downloading,surfing ,you tube vedio streaming was much faster than moto G.I don'e know if I am the only one who got this lemon or others are also facing similar issues. 5.One more thing abot Flipkart's monopoly of Flip cover,you guys are charging 1700 bucks for the flip cover,and the price is mentioned nowhere in the flipcover cas.So wants to know on which basis you guys are overcharging on it,Is it because It is not available anywhere in the market?",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,3 stars,CAMERA PROB,"The phone is good i have some issues with camera. - turn the flash on and try taking pics of close objects when u try 5-10 times it will stuck focusing. After that camera hangs with flash open , the only solution of this problem is to turn the mobile off( even when it is off flash will glow) , after restart if you open camera again and flash automatically off. I tried several times and dind it happen, phone will heat very much in this case, this is a major drawback. - Gaming is good but not to the extent ,my sony xperia l never closes game( clash of clans) automatically with laglag i used it for 1 year , but in 5 days it stops and closes my game. Now it is working though . Even when you play real cricket it will close automatically. - Else everthing is ok but sometimes u feel like using a cheap smartphone because sometimes it gets slow using multi tasking. - The quality of sony phones is better than this you can buy this not very bad for 13k. - 3 stars from my side.",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,1 star,Issue in Delivery of Moto G 2nd gen,"Very unpleasant experience. I placed order for MOTO G-2 on Sept 14 with expected delivery by 20 Sept. 2014 (payment COD). The courier person (from my city) called for delivery and I requested to deliver it on my address. But thereafter, I neither received call nor the product. When I called back to know when it will be delivered then to my surprise I was informed that shipment is lost and was requested to place another order (that I denied). After a couple of days person from Flipkart called me and informed that replacement product has been shipped on 23rd Sept BUT till date (Sept 27, 2014) the shipment status is baging completed and is still in Bangalore (the place of dispatch).  I feel that this time again they will give some excuse for non-delivery of product. If there is some issue in COD booking for my place then this should not be offered by the seller. If by luck I get the product (in whatever condition) I will place my review comments again as per the experience. BUT If any one really want that product be delivered by Flipkart in Uttar Pradesh then try some other online service. They may charge a little higher BUT ensure product delivery in time and Good condition",,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,2 stars,Dissapointed,"I bought a Moto G(1st Gen) for my mom a few months back & was thoroughly impressed by the snappiness & build quality. So when my old Lumia 720 conked off, the new Moto G(2nd gen) seemed like a natural choice.  Unfortunately, I'm a bit disappointed with the phone.  Although the screen is bigger, looks like they haven't changed the resolution of the phone at all. As a result, all the icons on the launcher look really big, blurry & a bit stretched. 1st Gen in comparison looks so much sharper!  Also, the silver strip jutting out from the top is really annoying. My ear hurts during a long call.   Nitpicking, but the size of the phone also seems awkward as the top left portion of the screen is completely inaccessible to my right thumb. Is it natural for all phones this size? Not sure, never owned one.  The speed & battery seem OK as of now, but it's only been a few days.",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,Moto G(2nd edition) a clear 5 Star :) Winner,The biggest difference between Samsung Phones like Quattro or Grand and Moto G is the zero lag feel in Moto G...Smooth and quick changeover from one screen to other...you can run no. of applications but there is no slowness. Second advantage is the time taken to click a pic is instant whereas in Samsung...you need to wait for fraction of second.

Till yesterday I waited for resolution, and once again called Flipkart to CANCEL my order if they can't ship it. Since yesterday the online option is also deleted from the portal, and Now I am stucked with my money and no product in my hand.   I am not going to rely on mercy of Flipkart, and have already decided to take next step to lodge official complaint for fraud, at Consumer forum, if the issue is not resolved by tomorrow.  From Now, Flipkart is a BIG...NO ....NO for me.",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,why you should go for Moto G 2nd incase you what to buy a smartphone..,"First let me start by saying the best phone for which you paying money... every things is awesome camera, especially selfie ...  what else you need ... you have this features what else you need....  1 GB RAM  Dual Sim (GSM + GSM)  1.2 Ghz Qualcomm Quad Core Processor  5-inch HD Screen  Expandable Upto 32GB(most important )  Android v4.4.4 (KitKat) OS( upgraded )  8 MP Primary Camera and 2 MP Secondary Camera  The front speaker are very good..... so far i am happy with MOTO G 2nd performance... as i am not a gamer i have not test the performance with gaming....  If i charge it full, it just last whole day with 3g use and with music , thats the only negative sight so far i found..  Instead going and spending more money with a higher range is like wasting money..  first what important for you... if you are not a gamer then definitely go for it...  Its the best value for money phone... have it... lastly, i the finishing is awesome as i not like square thing....  you can feel the finishing in your hand... that what matter at last.... If you dont like to spend more money it the best phone to buy its equivalent to of having a Rs. 22000 phone in yours have if you compare with other brands in the market with similar specificationd. The most important is that its tied up with Google. so what ever is new on the Google it will be automatically be updated on this phone... its a long term investment you should like to do...",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,1 star,Good Configuration with bad performance,I bought moto G 2nd gen 2 weeks ago. In my openion its a bad phone.It has good configuration but its battery performance is very poor.Also I am getting some issue with the speaker.Some times I try to make any call there will be no sound(dialing sound /beep) But the phone will be connected to the other end phone and I can not hear anything.If I am getting this issue I will restart the phone.Then it will be ok for a few hours. Another problem is with headset. If I use headsets for making call then the other end user can hear their own sound instead of my sound... I have a replacement option but I am not dare to do that because I have read a review in gsmarena web site that a friend had bought the same phone and he had isuue with the memory card slot. The card slot was not working.So he replaced the phone and he got a new one but the new one has issue with speakers....So he tried to change the phone again with flipkart in the very next day after he got the new phone but the fllipkart guys said they can not replace the phone again.........What can I do with this....If I try for a replacement I wil get a new moto G but how can I believe that I will get a good conditioned phone....

Even after more than 40 hrs I didn't get any call from the CC and when i called then again they told me that no complaint was launched. after a lot of struggle they took up the complain and again went silent for couple of days.  after few days one person called me and asked me about the complaint and told me that  SIT, THE CHARGER COSTS ONLY Rs 500/- U YOURSELF GET SOME SAMSUNG CHARGER.   Only when I yelled at him in local Tamil slang and told him that I am recording the whole conversation and I'll be taking complaint directly to Motorola and their management team he said that he will replace not only the charger but the whole phone. i got new phone the very next day  SUCH A POOR RESPONSE FROM FLIPKART.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,Awsome phone and equally good service by Flipkart - No cons,"First of all thanks to Flipkart for delivering the phone within 48 hours of booking. Now for the phone, well this is my first Android smart phone and i entirely concur with the Moto G's tagline - ""An excellent phone at an excellent price"".  The phone's design is sleek and light-weight. The back cover makes the phone less - slippery (especially if you are holding it with sweaty or wet hands, or using while travelling in bus / train, etc.). Multitasking is smooth. I used multiple apps (Chrome, Plant vs Zombies, Moon Reader, as well as play music) and it runs without any lag. The cameras are beautiful. I have done video chat via Skype using 2G Airtel Connection and the video quality and signal strength was very good and the sessions are smooth. Front speakers are clear and loud ( in fact i am yet to open the earphone). The music quality is superb. I have not encountered any phone heating problem although the charger gets heated while charging. Voice support recognizes voice quite easily. As for battery charge, since i am using lots of apps, i have to charge almost 2 times a day, but normally i think it will last more than 1 day if one limit the usage of apps. Call quality is equally good.  At the end i would recommend prospective buyers to use fast 3G or WiFi connection for optimum usage of phone.",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,1 star,Most disappointing thing is VIDEO CALL IS NOT THERE,"Only size, camera price and memory is not important in phone to purchase, there are many things need to observe, first day of announcement i have purchased 2 phone for me and my friend, i was completely disappointed with missing most important futures. 1. very very important front camera is there but just waste, because VIDEO CALLING IS NOT THERE. 2. In FM radio loudspeaker option is not there. 3. File manager is not there. 4. while talking in phone you can not connect to Bluetooth headset. 5. Notification light is there but it will not work while charging. 6. there is no different fonts. 7. we can not customize menu icons and u can not move to any pages. 8. DATA CABLE is not given. 9. EAR PHONES is low quality and old model, it hurts our ear. 10. There are so many options are missing compare to other android phones. Finally i spoke to Moto company customer service, they model design made as it is and they are helpless to solve this problems. It is my personal experience with the phone, hence i am requiting you people to think and decide before purchasing, after loosing money don't suffer, because already i am suffering with wasting money.",0 of 2 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,One day delivery : Awesome product,"First, the ease of placing an order on Flipkart and the delivery (Rs90 for next day delivery) was a good experience. This was my first Rs10k+ purchase of an online shopping and I was happy that Flipkart was able to deliver a good experience. I paid Rs 90 for the next day delivery and it bang on time. The product, a lot has been said on this, and I have just shifted (very late) from Nokia N97 mini Symbian to Andriod, so for me the product is a all wow. Let me note that my older N97 mini camera seemed a bit better than the MotoG in terms of clarity and taking photos. In MotoG, the focus is often getting lost before the photo is clicked. Otherwise all the features are nice. The RAM despite being 1GB is already gobbled up by about 50% by default applications.",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase
Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,4 stars,Worked Flawlessly so far!,"Till today, I haven't faced any noticeable lag. Bought it on the first day of its launch. Everybody knows the pros of this phone. Even though there are some minor cons like low ppi on higher 5 inch IPS display, it shouldn't bother much because we are talking about mid-range phone with great features!  I have faced 2 main cons in this phone after 20 days of usage. 1. When you turn on GPS for precise location reporting to google, battery drains out faster.  For me, it lasted only for 6 hours with GPS on. Solution : Turn on battery saving mode. Then it will last for more than 8-9 hours for average day usage along with net and some gaming.  2. This one is about accessory provided by motorola. The charger output is only 550 mah. So for this phone with 2200 mah capacity, it takes 4 complete hours to charge from completely drained battery. Which is pathetic! So one must consider to buy a new charger from market with output upto 1.5 mah.  Piece of advice: Go for this device if your budget is up to 13-15 k and you want great features with an update to android L.",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase
Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,"Same name, better experience","After using the phone for a week, i'll sum up my experience as follows:  1. Retains same excellent build as first gen with rubbery back. 2. Very well balanced phone that it feels lighter than 1st gen despite being bigger. 3. Stereo speaker is loud and clear but at max volume may distort a bit. But at least Motorola is giving something to the budget customers which are ignored by most. 4. Camera improved but HDR must be turned on for usable quality. 5. Pixel per inch dropped but sharpness remains same. Viewing angle & colour representation is same. 6. Maximum brightness is lower than 1st gen but hardly anyone use their phone at max brightness as it'll drain battery in a couple of hours. 7. Volume & Power button are little hard but that means it'll no longer get unlocked by accident. But sadly the buttons wobble a bit. 8. Backup time is little lower but can easily last a day with some amount of music, games & web browsing. Standby time is really good. No wakelocks. 9. Play game, watch movies or download over 3G, the phone remains cool. I have no idea how Motorola did this but impressive never the less. 10. Smoothness remains same since 1st gen. Disabling unnecessary apps clean up more ram. 11. With new looks may finally win a beauty contest or two. Or at least will make it to finale. 12. 3G on both sims now possible. AFAIK, 1st gen was 3G+2G, but now its 3G+3G. 13. Gyroscope is now present. Absent in 1st gen. Go play with photosphere (Google camera) 14. Stock screenguard can be used but it of really bad quality. Still should get one going for a few months. Another free gift. 15. Finally you can read the complete review at digit forum.",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,Good Product and Value for money with some minor technical issue,I purchased the product on the lunch day and Flipkart delivered it on Monday in noida . Already people saying a lot off Pros and cons for it . But its a good product and value for money and better than moto g 1st version . It having moderate backup . I used to all time on wifi and dual sim on and gives me all day backup . Already people post a lots of positive about it . But being a mobile test engineer i feel certain issue with this device   1. The Wifi tethering range cover - Its quite low from other device . Even you wont get a 70-80 signal strength in a room at 3-4 meter distance . Even the signal drops after 7-8 meter range  2.Charging time is too much probably the provided charger is only 550mAh output . For 5 inch screen it should be at least 1A. Use a good charger instead of free charger for fast charging  3.Chance of scratch in lense is high. It should be placed little depth inside  large gap in between speaker grill . Possibility of dust and sweat enter is high  4.The earpiece is cheap quality  5.Loose power keys and volume keys. These made of plastic . Moto G having better and metal like  keys .,0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

To add to impress me there was this Motorola migrate interface which made my switch of mobile heck lot easier. Touchscreen, display, colour, contrast, resolution all well above expectation. Overall no interface issues as such. Camera works smooth and fast click option adds 1 more point to it.

You have all the features of a high end phone.. Camera quality is good... The speakers are quite loud... The phone looks sturdy and fits in the hand nicely... It has a ideal screen size, neither too big nor too small... What i really liked was the battery backup especially when it reaches below 50 percent... It generally lasts the day (after a good 2 to 3 hours of gaming and talking on the phone and listening to music..)  The expandable memory and the dual sim are of course a luxury... All in all a wonderful product considering it is for only 13k....  Though i was really disappointed with the delivery service of flipkart..Received the product after around 7 days of ordering.. Finally received a call from the flipkart representative that the product will be delivered today... Asked him to come around 6.30 to my house as i am working and cannot receive it before that..He flatly refused (even though they claim to deliver the product till 7!!)..The i told him to come around 5.30 so he said that he would not come to my place but asked me to meet at a neutral location..

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,3 stars,moto G(2nd Gen) v/s moto G(2013)...Bad display quality....really bad....just pale yellow.,"Moto G(2nd Gen) v/s Moto G(2013). Hi, this is the first time writing the review. I already have moto G(2013).On purchasing new moto G(2nd Gen),these are the differences i realized on comparing both of the devices. 1.The major differences is screen resoultion. As one may think 294ppi is good resolution.But it is good only on paper because when it comes to performance.It is just pale yellow screen you get. It feels slugish and also the screen brightness levels are not up to the expectation,especially if you compare the screen with old moto G which is a beast when it comes to screen performance(326ppi). 2. Handling moto G(2nd gen) is not that easy as the device has much bigger form factor compared to other 5 inch devices. 3.In terms of speed and performance moto G(2nd gen) is little slower as compared to old moto G.But overall a decent performance.  At the end I would like to say is that moto G(2nd gen) is still a great device at this price tag.Just because motorola has stopped selling old moto G(2013) edition which will be the best device built at this price tag.Also Xiaomi Mi3 is no longer available on flipkart.",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,Best VFM phone on the market,"Want to keep this review short as there are many expert reviews on the internet.  One of the best value for money phones on the market right now. Excellent screen, snazzy performance and superb sound. Many reviews I found mentioned that the there is only one loud speaker at the bottom and the other one on the top is just for call listening- but as I found while playing music on speaker sound comes from both speakers and is quite clear and loud. Not sure whether its stereo though.  All in all a much much better alternative to the flooding of unknown chinese brands in the market.",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase
Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,Great phone Everything I was looking for at this price,My first Android phone. Delivery was in time  Courier guys could have been better as the package had arrived in Pune a day in advance but they waited a full day before delivery  Came packed well and everything as advertised. Starting the phone was a great experience as the graphics and screen clarity really jumps out at you  The stereo effect speakers are too good and no need for any external speakers etc  The graphics are excellent for the price range and love watching short videos especially with the stereo sound. One can even lie down in bed and watch it like a private TV  Handling is fine ergonomic aspect of controls are excellent and one does not have to strain Even one handed touch is great for most of the common tasks  There is a bit of lag for even some common tasks running simultaneously but nothing to complain about Buy a micro SD card as you will be saving /watching a lot of videos and songs due to the excellent graphics and sound quality The only cons that seem to be is that the battery lasts for barely a full working day and needs charging by night even with normal use  When checking the contact list even a light touch on the contact person starts a voice call  Bit irritating till you figure this out Lot of unwanted mistaken dialling for the first couple of days One needs to press on the contact for a few seconds to open up the contact details Overall the best phone at the price and top of its range Snap it up before it goes out of stock,0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase
Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,4 stars,Good Phone,"Really a smart phone, a definite improvement of processor. Browsing and downloads are faster. Speakers are also good so recommended to the music lovers. Bigger screen makes the watching a video and playing games a better experience.  Battery is also good considering the screen size and last for about 12 hrs on 3G network with average calling, music and internet use. If you are a bookworm, the screen consumes the battery more and will drain faster. The only disappointment is its camera which boasts of 8 MP but lacks sharpness, the autofocus is not good and very less features to chose from, such as lack of adjustment of contrast, sharpness etc. No effects except for the panorama and burst mode. Barring the camera quality and features a definitely good buy at 13k.",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,1 star,No where near expectations,"I got the delivery of Moto G2 from Flipkart on 22.09.2014. Nice looking phone. Good size. but i am not a big fan of games or huge net surfing on phone. only thing i thought of using this phone for Whatsapp (business purpose) or some facebook status updates. But to my utter surprise, when i installed whats app in it, it started lagging. hanged up twice on very 1st hour of usage. no game installed, no heavy app installed.   I thought android shud be better then Windows phone( my wife uses Nokia 720 for lawt 1 year), but its not so. Camera is pathetic (or my set has some problem). even my blacberry 8520 clicks better snaps that this MOTO G2.all the snaps taken from this are grainy. not even one is clear. i have seen moto g(2013), and that has better camera than my Moto G2. to my utter disappointment the front speaker is not at all loud. Voice reception quality is also no where near blackberry 8520. Battery backup is pathetic. its screen eats up 47% of the battery. i dont use MoBILE DATA, coz i have wi-fi 24*7. not even 1hr of daily phone calls usage. still the battery keeps demanding power backup.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,Moto G (2nd Gen),"I had bought a MOTO G earlier for my wife and was so impressed by its flawless performance and battery life that I decided to go for the MOTO G (2nd Gen) for my dad. I feel the phone is an excellent value for money budget phone with all the features of a high end one. The Moto G (2nd Gen) display experience is remarkable and its wide screen is very user friendly for elderly folks like my dad whose eyesight may not be as sharp as the new age folks. The UI touch experience, the battery life, the ability to host multiple apps without deterioration in performance is a sheer delight for end users. My family members also have an Experia which is higher priced and has frequent software issues. The Experia gets stuck quite often, when multiple apps are loaded and it conflicts with the missed call display software and one is not able to figure out from where the calls are received. Compared to such issues, the MOTO G (Gen 2) is a remarkable phone and has no rough edges as the software is thoroughly tested and refined for an excellent end user experience.",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,4 stars,Best under 15000rs. Amazing Phone with Moto brand & mid range features.,"Well I have used 1st gen Moto G for 6 months & I ordered Moto G (2nd Gen) on 18th Sept 14 & received it on 20th Sept :D. After using I realised it having some clot on display screen & then find out its not bubble or scratch its display problem. Though an average user won't notice it. Checked by moving phone on every angle possible on full brightness. So requested replacement on 18th itself. But replacement taking time but will will be done by 27th Sept I guess. & 4 stars just due to have to replace it else would be 5 Stars.   Well moving on.  Pros: 1. 5"" display looks crisp & sharp . 2. Easy to hold in hand (Good Grip) 3. Memory Card slot (The most wanted update) 4. 1st Gen was lagging lot but so for it working smoothly 5. Dialler looking good than previous one. 6. 2 speakers (Yes its Stereo), Even Nexus 5 having 2 speakers but only plays through 1 speaker. But Moto G 2nd gen Speakers are really good. 7. Battery working better than 1st gen. 8. I don't know anyone noticed this change or not But BackCover of 2nd gen is more flexible. It makes it really tough to break instead of plastic body.  Cons:  1. Speakers start cracking if you push it to extreme Bass. (But works fine normally) 2. FM radio can't be played on Loud Speakers (Only on Headset) 3. Phone take forever to charge (Better to keep it on charging while sleeping)  4. Multi Colour LED notification would be better. 5. Better to buy new charger & Headphones ( Headphones are plastic headed & uncomfortable & Charger gets heated very much) 6. Still 1 GB ram & old processor  Overall Verdict : But here & there if you are Normal user its one of Best phone available. I chose thisone over Asus Zenphone with better specs.

Battery back up just okay..if you work on internet in your phone continuously for 2 hr, the entire charge is exhausted...   The 2 new stereo speaker kills the look of the phone and adds no extraordinary value.",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,4 stars,Great Phone With Great Capability :) :) \m/,"After doing a lot of research i purchased moto g 2nd gen few days back its a fantabulous (fantastic +fabulous ) phone. Although i am not a gadget freak but still have gud knowledge about phones and moto g is 2nd gen is my first Smart Phone.  So i may say that this phone with latest version of android is hadsomely working well, it has a quite good camera quality, in fact i was worried about battery backup but it is gud (up to 14 hours once charged fully) if u using wifi then battery gets used up very fast.   As well i have compared it with moto g 1st model and other cell phones like macro max etc this phone is far better in terms of look and battery (as i have noticed).   one important point of video conferencing, as i did so as per my observation this phone get heats up very very quickly i guess with in 15 - 20 mins only (that is something i dint like about this phone but later i came to know that it is very common phenomena ....please check.... is it really ????)   If you are worried about cell phone getting hang then till now as my use is too much so till now twice it hanged, now this is not a very big problem almost all phones hang even some of my friends were complaining that Mi 3 also hangs.  coming on to speakers ie dual speakers i didn't find them that good. The voice gets cracked on high notes.   this review is being written for confused buyers. people trust me if u r purchasing moto g then it is right investment.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,Excellent phone at great price,"I had bought a Moto G from Flipkart earlier and upgraded to Moto G 2nd Gen on the day of the launch. Moto G 2nd Gen is an excellent buy at a great price. Mobiles with similar specs are much costlier. There is not much difference in hardware and software between Moto G and its second generation avtaar. However, Motorola has filled the shortcoming of Moto G in the second generation --- the prime being having a expandable memory slot which lacked so badly in Moto G. With a bumped-up screen of 5 inches, the second generation Moto G looks more tempting to use. Though the screen size is large, the design is so good that it doesn't feel bulky in hands, compared to other similarly sized mobiles. Moto G second generation is worth the price in all aspects. So anyone looking for a good spec mobile under 15k, this is the best buy as of now.",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,Very nice phone WITH EXCEPTIONAL PRICE,"I am reviewing a product in flip-kart for the first time. Really it is a great phone. Nice piece of work done by Motorola. Yesterday i have received the phone. In the first look only i am amazed to see it. It is not so bulky though it is 149 gm. It comfortably fits in my hand. The performance of the phone is really outstanding. Am using asus zenfone 450cg also. You believe this or not when i compared the weight of both the mobiles surprisingly asus(133 gm) is little bit more bulky than moto g 2nd generation. I recommend every user who are in doubt in buying this phone to, just go for it.  No second thought please go for it. Much better than Asus zenfone 5 or 6.",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,3 stars,nice phone but its dead in 2 months and moto service center is pathetic,"the phone is awesome and looks stylish. camera quality is really nice.  What I dont like is the icons in menu are too large due to which it looks like micromax and other cheap phone. And there is no option to reduce the icon size.  Also the lock and volume buttons are too hard to press. Due to 5"" inch size the phone seems uncomfortable.  although it is a fair deal and this is a nice phone for such low price. features are same as nexus 5 except RAM.  I would also like to tell that the phone is now dead within 2 months and from last 10days service center is saying they dont have the part for replacement. so their service is pathetic...nokia and samsung are way better as far as servicing is concerned.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,Techies Choice:Best In the Budget,"I have been using this phone from last two weeks and please find my observations below:  Before going into pros and cons i want to mention that i have previously used Sony Experia T2,HTC 816,HTC 616,Lumia925,Nexus4 and Nexus 5.  Pros: 1. Stock Android with smooth touch.The guaranteed update is also a plus but the thing i want to mention that there is no difference between MotoG2's UI and Nexus 5's UI. I know this statement is not easily acceptable but this is true.  2.The best part is 5 inch display with HD resolution is a better combination and different view angles.are also great.  3.Quad-core processor with 1gb Ram is the core of this phone.It is the true fact that the more will be the Ram the better will be performance of the android.So far no lagging not even in the case of high end games though I did not try all of the high end games.  4.8 MP primary camera with Flash and 2MP secondary Camera.I have tested the camera quality different times in night and i did not find any thing bad.Picture quality is good from both the cameras.  5.48 gb(16 gb internal+32 gb extendable) is more than enough.Micro sd card in this version is a real advantage over the previous version.  6.Excellent design and build quality.I have been using this phone without screen guard and Flip cover and there is nothing to complain.If you are a rough user like me then this phone will not give you any chance to complaint.  7.Excellent sound quality with and without head phone.  Cons: 1.Battery is a little concern but again the whole world knows that Snapdragon processors consume more battery than any other processors. There is a pros in cons that the phone will not take too much time to charged up again and usb charging is also an option.   Don't believe on the fake comments,it is by far the best budget phone and it is also reliable.",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,Best Mobile at Reasonable rate,"Here are the first impressions -   1. Screen: Nice, crisp and vivid, but only 720p. With Snapdragon 400, I guess 720p makes more sense than 1080p. It is 5 inches in size but feels compact and usable in single hand. 2. Performance: Android 4.4.4 comes pre-installed. Lag-free so far. Runs Riptide GP pretty well. Should run all games meant for Snapdragon 400. MS Office, Facebook and Google Drive all work fast and fine.  3. Sound: The front dual speakers are awesome. Very nice sound. None of the other Motos (E/G/X) so far had this kind of fidelity.  4. Camera: 8 MP main cam & 2 MP front. Very good snaps so far both indoors and outdoors. Got only 20 mins to experiment :) 5. Call quality: 2 mics with noise cancellation and a loud speaker! Feels good. 6. Micro SD Slot: This is the greatest inclusion. Moto G sorely missed that. Good option. 7. What else do you want? :) C'mon guys what else do you expect from a phone at this price point? It won't cook your meals or solve your financial problems. Use it practically.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,4 stars,Best Android in its Class and Beyond,"Bought this little gem of a device in the first week of its release,had some issues with build quality,so got it replaced,(btw great work and response from Flipkart),coming to the device,its the best android out there in the sub 25k price range (yes 25k),because it beats its competitors and so called flagships of last year hands down,well i will list the best features as per my usage and liking,  1. Gorgeous Display,color reproduction and viewing angles are much better even than some AMOLEDS in this price range. 2. Gaming performance is Good if not Great,ran Asphalt 8,Real Racing 3,MC4 & FIFA14 Smoothly without any lag(though frame rates arent that high),but no noticeable lag during gameplay. 3. Call quality is Top Notch,most phones fare dismally in this area. 4. Camera quality is markedly improved upon the previous gen device,can take beautiful shots if in good conditions.  What i Din't like:  1. Aggressive app management,not good at multi-tasking other than switching between social networks. 2. Battery performance is average.  well i cant think of any other major flaws,that said its a pretty solid device,if you have a budget of around 25k,i would even say 30k,just buy this device and save the money,its WORTH IT.",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,Abe bacche ki jaan lega kya !!!,"Most of the people are comparing this phone with its predecessor and hence don't find it mind blowing. Moto G first gen buyers also don't find this phone better which I think is complete bullshit. Probably they are jealous of this one. 5 inch screen,front dual speakers,good camera and expendable storage are some of the reasons why I bought this phone. I have used Moto-G first gen also but 2 nd gen is quite an improvisation. 5 star for price/features package.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,MOTOROLA MOTO G 2nd GENERATION BEST SMARTPHONE IN IT'S PRICE RANGE,"Got my smartphone 3 days ago and still exploring many things about it.  First of all the Moto G 2nd Generation improved itself from its older version Moto G 1st by BIG 5"" screen, external 32 GB capacity SD card slot, high quality dual front speakers, 8 MP rear and 2 MP front camera.  Here are my reviews after using the smarphone - 1.Build and Design- It looks good and seems Sturdy. New Moto G has 5"" display with polycarbonate back. Look just the larger version of Moto G 1stGen But it looks distinctly like the Moto X 1st Gen from the back. It Doesn't feel very heavy and its new curved edges give the device a better overall feel that makes it eaisier to hold.  2.Display and UI- It has 720p HD IPS LCD with 294 ppi density and with the protection of corning gorilla glass 3 makes the screen stronger, premium and sharp.  Moving on the UI front, it runs stock Android 4.4.4 kitkat. Motorola has also promised with a guaranteed update to Android L on Moto G 2nd Gen. UI runs smoothly and I didn't see a lag so far.  3.Sound- It has the best sound quality from Moto E and also from Moto X.  4.Performance- As in the older generation it runs on 1.2 GHz Qualcomm snapdragon 400 quad-core SOC and has 1 GB of ram. It also has adreno 305. All this makes Moto G 2nd gen a great smartphone in terms of performance. High end games like Asphalt 8 and respownables etc. runs very smooth. I didn't see any crashes on the device in games or other apps.  5.Battery- It has the same 2070 battery as the old one though it didn't disappoint me and I got 10-12 hours of it easily.  6.Camera- Better than the old one it has 8 MP rear camera with better sensor and 2 MP front camera. Quality is very good when taken in HDR mode and also in low light condition.  The new Moto G is a very good competitor in its price range and it upholds MOTOROLA's tradition of providing great quality smartphones. In my opinion you all can confidently buy this smartphone. It will never gonna disappoint you.",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,4 stars,Worth every penny!,"As someone who has previously owned the first gen Moto G, i'll have to say that the second gen Moto g is lighter,thinner and easier to hold, despite having a larger screen. The screen is sharp and worth every penny, just like the previous gen moto g. Build quality is solid. And the front speakers are a nice touch. The bezel space that was left empty has been put to full use now. The first gen Moto g had random signal dropping issues. The newer version doesn't have any such problems. And the addition of memory card slot is another welcome addition. Samsung class 10 evo memory card works like a breeze with the new G. I'd suggest Moto G (Gen 2) to anyone who's looking for a good handset under 15k.",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

It never hangs, heat up, or restart. Battery is a minor issue as it runs not for whole day nd takes upto 3 hours for charging. Gaming is unmatched. Speaker quality is excellent. Camera is much improve as compared to previous moto g. I compared it wid my friend who has its predecessor.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,2 stars,moto g 2nd gen,"My first hand exp with the phone is NOT GOOD. The main issue being very unresponsive or some times non responsive touch screen . Earlier I was using S4 (which was stolen) so opted for MOTO G 2. But I could gauge the sea diff between the two starting from the operation of the screen, touch pad not so well designed for thumb operations etc are the very basic issues which can make you really frustrated. Now I get jitters when i have operate the phone esp if I have to text/type .   Frustrated , I called up flip cart and asked for return to which they said ""NA"" for mobile phone. (this was a discovery for me ). I said atleast you replace the piece, to which they are yet to come back. .  Touchscreen issues I googled on , stated that its very common for moto g . I am in a fix now. Stuck with a bad phone to which all the techie sites claim to be the best phone etc. They must be going on tech specs of the phone rather than user experience of the same.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,3 stars,I expected more in MOTO-G (2nd Gen),"I received the phone just next day of its launch, not much ""Gold Rush"" kind of thing for this product launch, may be because of so many new mobile phone launched between MOTO-E and Moto-G (2nd Gen) by others.  Appearance of the phone is good with distinguish screen size as compare to old Moto G, but, build quality has got some issues, like in my phone the display panel is not uniformally sitting on balanced plane (the gap between display screen and the surrounding metal Rim is not even), at some points when I slide my fingures, I feel that protruding rim, I am afraid of loosing the paint of the Rim.  Next, I found the internet connectivity over mobile networks is an issue, it takes quite long to switch over from 2G to 3G, moreover, sometimes it does not switch at all, the reason may be the options given in the setting, only one option is given as preferred network selection, where as in my HTC there were 3 options (1) 2G, (2) 3G (3) Preferred Network 3G.  Battery is barely lasting for a day with moderate usage and keeping the phone on 2G mode, on 3G it drains out quickly even with out lighting up the display (display consumes max battery).  The camera is good but, no better than my HTC's 5Mega Pixel camera, the flash is not sufficient enough and the LED is not on the surface it is 3-4 mm inside the backcover due to which the flash light's strength and coverage is not good at all (in Moto G, old version it was on the surface). Again the flash strength of my HTC was much much better.  Overall, I am having a mixed feeling of owning one but, soon I will look for a new phone in higher end segment, coz wrt price you can not live life with lot of compromises.",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Not so G-ood!,"I most truly thought that android was the worst operating system in existance, but, hoped that MotoG would change that view for me.  Long answer short: Still hate android! This phone hangs more times than hangman.  One positive is that when when it does work,it works quite alright.  Actually, I feel bad for moto. Had they had another OS this phone would have been quite remarkable.  Android users might gag on this review, but, you've got no idea how an OS should work until you've used iOS, which has nothing to do with hardware sadly. So yeah.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,AWSOME,"hey frends, if u r looking for an android smartfone.... this is it... if u want to buy a phone below 20000 then dont think twice.... if bought moto g 1st gen (16gb) for my gf. believe me it was cheap and best. when i came 2 know bout 2nd gen, i quickly sold my xperia and ordered new moto g on launch day itself. trust me frenz. its awsome. bigger screen. superb camera. which i genrally use to take pics of notes in my college. clarity is amazing. and fort facing dual speakers make me smile when i watch hd movies or videos... battery lasts full day. after using it for 2 weeks without screen guard, no scratches at all. headfones r ok. ram is sufficent and i enjoyed asphalt 8 and riptide gp2. i havent added any sd card. for me 16 gb is more than enough yaar... :-) i use an otg pendrive. for watching movies. got an update in just 10 days.  dont waste ur money in stupid phones from samsung. i loved sony. but they r expensive. if u worry about customer care. let me tell u. my gf accidently dropped her moto g 1st gen in pool :-D . after which it stopped working. i took it to a moto sericve centre in sakchi(jamshedpur) and got it repaired in 1 day...!!! after 2 months its still working fine. i suggest dont buy Xaiomi micromax lava karbon helium hydrogen oxygen.... and got knows what what.... thought their specs r good at cheap price. but their quality and service quality is mind blowing. i ones made a mistake of buying a canvas which i regretted after 2 months... :-)  the looks of new moto g is very stylish and grip is very good. i think its most compact 5 inch phone available....  believe me its perfectly perfect considering its price...  i suggest just buy it without comparing it with other costly handsets... al d best.",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,4 stars,excellent product....not very satisfactory delivery from flipkart,"I will start with the product first, I have been using for the past 10 days, this being stock android, there is absolutely no lag in the phone, it is swift and fast, no matter how much you overload it with apps. I have used an s3 previously which is double the price, I can say that moto g in terms of performance is way better.   Now coming to ergonomics, the phone has best build quality, I felt no need for any kind of protective covers, for a casual observer, it looks very expensive. There is no pixallation on the screen, but still the colours are not great. The screen is 5inch with 1280x720p,,S3 had 4.8 inch with 1280x720p, but the s3's screen was way better, there is no comparision.   Music clarity(in ear phones), screen clarity and camera are better in a Rs10000 samsung than moto g.  All rounded up as a package, this is one of the best phones in this category , the User interface is awesome, never gets stuck,,,,just flows and flows...supports any kind of games and apps.  Coming to the delivery by flipkart, I was utterly dissatisfied, they have delivered me a day after the promised date.

The 16GB inbuilt memory plus additional expandable memory with a memory card is a huge plus. The display is super amazing. Loved the entire look and feel of the phone.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,4 stars,Moto G (2nd Gen) vs Asus Zenfone 5 (8GB),"Hi Everyone,  I bought Asus on my birhday after a long waiting. Here are some points I would like to share.   1. Look and Feel Personally I like zenfon , it looks very cool ( 5/5 ). although moto is also good ( 4/5 ).  2. Accessibility..  Zenfone has many sortcuts for settings, wi -fi , mobille data, etc as it has a separate shutter for that ( 5/5 ). But in Moto G you need to do some job to get these options. ( 3.5/5 ).   3. Camera zenfone camera has got less points ( 3.5/5 ). in this section compare to Moto G ( 5/5 ). . In night zenfone camera is like 2 MP while Moto G beats he apple i-phone 4s(although it is 5 MP) in clarity.  4. Speaker and Headphones sounds -- speakers of the phones are almost equal in sound quality  -- moto G ( 5/5 ). is louder than asus ( 3.5/5 ).  -- headphones sounds of asus ( 5/5 ). is much better than moto ( 3.5/5 ).   5. Speed -- Zenfone ( 5/5 ). and Moto G2 ( 4.5/5 ).    Thats it all I experience. I would prefer Moto G as its quality and services both are good. But asus will also be a good choice. :)",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase
Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,4 stars,Impressive with few caveats,"Flilpkart was impressive as always and the phone was delivered within 32 hours without opting for Same day/Next day delivery :). In the last 2.5 years, I have changed phones in this order- Iphone -> Samsung -> Lumia -> Iphone -> HTC -> Moto G2 and this helps me with fair deal of experience!!  Pros: 1) The price!! I mean- Quad core + Kitkat + 8mp shooter + 5inch HD Screen + Quad Core + Brand. All in one is definite VFM. I'm not the touch experience on MicroMax or other Cheaper handsets. 2) HD screen is impressive for daily use 3) No qualms on the 1gb RAM + the Quad core processor- No lag observed with daily use 4) Speaker vol + Music Quality on headphones are good at this price point. I bought a Seinnheisser Headphone and Music Quality is Great!! 5) 16 GB internal + 32 GB expandable. Really a lot of space!! I hated Iphone for this and HTC gave just 8GB internal memory. Struggled with Apps, but no more...  Cons 1) Sadly the Battery needs serious consideration. 30 mins of gaming or browsing kills it by ~ 30%. I am skeptical of even those 2 hour wait whilst my wife is shopping. Won't be able to move around without a charger and reminds me of the > 3 year old HTC phones 2) Processor is mediocre for Games. Won't recommend Asphalt/CSR Real Racing 3) Strangely, the network reception was average compared to my previous phones. Comparable to probably Iphone 4  Overall, I would still recommend this for anyone on a budget. The phone is excellent at this price point and I wish if the battery had more juice. But hey, I can't think of any other phones under 25K which is this impressive!!   Again, I hate the touch interface on Micromax/Karbonn/Xolo and lot of other 'New' Players in the market. Probably Xiaomi or Oppo is good enough, however being the conservative guy that I'm, better off sticking to the 'known' brands, atleast for the after sales service reliability.",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,Worth every penny,"Moto g was a huge sale and moto g2 is even better. The features that are better from the first one are:  1. Screen size 5'' 2. Android version 4.4.4 3. Better cam 8 MP 4. Expandable memory  I tried running asphalt 8 which is a game of 1.5 GB and it ran smoothly without any lag. The only con is when you take a pic, the widescreen setting 16:9 uses 6 MP and if u make it 8 MP then the aspect ratio comes down to 4:3.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,MOTO G Awesome Phone,"It has been 4 days I have purchased this mobile phone. This phone looked classy which other phones in its range fail to show. Not much going into technical details, as in the other reviews, I would rather like to tell about how I felt using the phone. I had previously a Samsung Grand Duos. It had a pathetic performance when I had to run several applications. It used always freeze and lag constantly even when scrolling through icons. Well that time is over with me purchasing Moto G, a gorgeous phone with Android Kitkat which will be upgraded to Android 'L' in the coming October month. Their isn't much upgrade from the previous Moto G but then then the phone works like a charm with lags which is I wonted the most. The gaming on this phone is also good. The only thing that I noticed was the playing games for longer time is heating up the phone. The charger also gets heated up when its charging the phone. The default head phones are crappy but the external speakers makes you say wow! Go with JBL, Skull Candy or Bose head phones to replace the crappy default headphones. Overall the performance is great... This is the best budget phone and you can go for it.",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,4 stars,Decent large screen phone with dual loudspeaker & good battery life,"Although no Android phone will currently replace my primary iPhone, but, this is a good second device with a large screen, reasonably loud volume and a surprisingly good battery life.  I had to get the initial piece replaced since there were some audio volume related issues, but, the next one was okay. FlipKart is quite reliable and fast with these kind of issues.  The camera is just about okay for stills. Video is somewhat better. It does have issues initialising the camera at times when using the slo-mo. The camera app needs some work...  The GPS works fast enough when locking in locations across apps, which, seems to be a marked improvement over some of the older Android devices.  The touch accuracy & response is much better than the Samsung S4 that I got rid of. After installing a few apps, the phone does seem to slow down a tad, but, that is mostly Android than the Moto G. The overall UI/UX is also better than the Samsung UI/UX and some of the other Android devices I have tried in the past.  NFC is missing, would have been nice to have. A better camera, quality wise, not MP wise, would have made this device an even better deal. The camera does have the capacity to shoot wide-screen at 6 MP and that is a nice feature to have in certain situations.  With a guaranteed update to the next release of Android and the current device running the latest now, adds to the overall value of the device.  The included Moto Assist is a fairly nifty app unlike the junk bundled with the Samsung devices. The Motorola support site is also fairly well organised. I went through it when trying to find a solution to the audio volume issue on the first piece I received.  The charger and headset seem to be cheap at best. I have not even tried them so far.  Overall, a good device for the price, performance and future upgradability.",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,4 stars,Premium Phone at affordable price !!,"I have ordered this phone on the launch day. The delivery arrived two days earlier than mentioned. 5 stars to flipkart on that !!   Coming to the product... It is very good looking and sturdy build.  Form factor : 8/10 - Very good build and has a premium look to it.  Display : 7/10 - The first thing to notice in this new version. awesome 5-inch display. Though the PPI is down from the original moto g, there is very little pixelation seen to the naked eye.  Accessories - 7/10 - A little disappointed here.. There is no USB cable in the box or even not detachable USB cable - cum - charger as seen in recent phones. May be it is a cost cutting measure and motorola might have thought that we should be holding a USB cable already. Battery - 7/10 - Given the big 5-inch screen, the battery capacity should have been increased. However,it should be fine to run a full day even with wifi on but should drain out earlier if on continuous videos/3G internet browsing. Performance - 8/10 - The touch and the navigation among applications is as smooth as ever. Heavy games and applications also ran smooth. Processor and RAM- 7/10 - Disappointed here.. Should have been increased to 2GB RAM . Also, the quad-core processor is fine enough but not the latest. I understand that at this price range, it is acceptable. Camera - 8/10 - 8MP camera is a welcome upgrade from the original moto g. The pictures are more sharp and crisp. Storage - 8/10 - One more addition which is well thought of by motorola about the future. Enabled me to push more music,photos,apps to the card.  Overall - 8/10 - There are some phones coming in this range very recently and the competition in the budget smartphone segment is tougher than the original moto g days but motorola is a trusted brand and this phone should carry the legacy well.",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Kitkat is really awesome, But it must be with some level of the customisation. Some time got an error after downloading 75% of application , So that's the OS Problem, It should be resolved by updating your device, But Still waiting for updates.

Configured my Exchange email and found that it keeps on syncing again and again. Later found the LED Flash was not working. Its the worst that can happen to anyone.  **UPDATE**  flipkart delivered replacement in just 1 day. Thanks flipkart.  Device Review:-  First of all it looks impressive. Bigger display is great and screen is vivid and sharp. Don't know why are peple complaining about sharpness of the screen. It's crisp and bright.  All I missed is the black background of Apps menu. Now it has been changed to same as wallpaper.  It has 1 GB of RAM out of which 851 MB is accesible and 300-400MB always remains free so no lag out there. Snapdragaon 400 does all the jobs quickly. Its really fast.  I faced issue about the exchange email in which phone keeps on syncing email again and again making device hot and battery draining quickly. Later, I came to know that it was a bug in Android not in the MOTO G. Hope Google will fix in the Android L update.  8mp camera is good. It focuses quickly and captures great shots but sucks in nights. Front camera is good too but I see some lag.  Gaming on the device is mindblowing. It runs every game without lag or crash. Like Asphalt 8, GTA SA, Dead Trigger etc.  Received firmware update yesterday and it added some new wallpapers to the phone.  Its worth buy.

I am not sure which party- Manufacturer or the retailer- erred with the product. So this is just a warning to the aesthetic buyers- BEWARE of products you buy online.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,4 stars,An Excellent Budget Smartphone!!,"Excellent product in this price range. Iv been using this for about 5 days now and haven't faced any kind of issues till yet. According to me, the pros would be"": 1. Excellent camera quality, primary 8 mp can capture image even in pitch black darkness with the help of flash. Secondary camera,2mp captures good images in daylight and fairly decent images in ambient light. 2.All Google apps inbuilt and the personal assistant-OK,Google detects the words and sentences very accurately and provides results superfast provided you have a decent internet connectivity. 3.Display is fantastic, 5 inches and full HD-it cant get better!! 4.2 Speakers on the front side with loud music(not comparable with sony or apple though) 5.I installed about 12-15 apps-no lagging problems. Im not a gaming person so i dont know about high end games but games like temple run work perfectly.  Cons: 1.Brightness is not as good as its older counterpart-moto g.But its manageable, screen is visible in full brigtness when outdoors. 2.Battery life not as good as Moto g. If you wish to continuously use your phone for 12-13 hours straight in office keeping your WiFi and email sync on, making and receiving calls, editing documents,etc, i dont think this battery would suffice. Ul have to charge it for sometime in between.I think it would go for 8-9 hours with high usage. 3.No usb cord was provided in the box.  All in all a good product. Have recommended to many friends of mine. And yeah, faster than expected delivery by flipkart. Good packing too. Happy Karting!!",0 of 1 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,1 star,Pray before you order so that you are lucky enough to not to recieve the faulty piece.,"I ordered the handset on 12th september and it was delivered on 16th sep. I donot know what the hell toop flipkart so long to deliver the phone. Anyways, I opened the box to see an impressive looking handset. And this was the end of all of my joys. The screen guard given with the handset was really pathetic with a lot of air bubbles and spaces. And the worst of all you cannot even change it as it is not available in the market. Secondly, the touch screen was not responsive while using the camera function. At first I thought tha it was due to the gap between the screen guard and the actual screen of the handset. But after using the phone for three days it is now confirmed that the touch response has some real issues, i literally had to hammer the screen at times to make it work. It really sucks. I have made a replacement request to flipkart and they say that they will give me a call back on 23 sep. and then they would start their procedure of pick up and re-delivery. God knows how long will they take. I dont think these freaks check the articles before delivery, which they should if they boast to be exclusive seller of the product. Strogly dis satisfied with both the product and the service. This is the reason i have given a rating of 1 to flipkart but the fact is that i wanted give a rating of -1",,Verified Purchase
Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,Don't hesitate (for 20 k budget ),"This is the best phone you can buy in india under 20000 right now .... Pros : Display , battery , gpu , processor , android updates everything is great for the price point  Cons : 1. You have wait for the update from motorola bcoz right now moto g 2nd gen have lot of bugs and u dnt have to worry they will surely update it . so thats out of the way   2. Another con is that if u are in maharashtra and you dont live in pune and mumbai flipkart's delivery is rarely available anywhere . that was issue when o recommended this phone to my uncle and we got lot of delivery problems . After 4-5 calls to flipkart my started to feel skeptical about buying this phone. FLipkart's customer care is great but there are some call centre guys who disconnect your phone after asking to wait for 5-10 mins . Then I thought they were just doing it on toll free helpline but no when tried other helpline I lost my 18 rs balance they still hung up on me . I dont know what they were thinking that i was not interested in buying or what but . I wasn't satisfied with customer support.  Overall you can surely buy this phone if your budget is under 20k and if you have higher budget you can buy when moto x 2 comes . If you dont care about budget problem then buy new nexus which will come out this october.",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

With the smartphone industry updating itself all the time, I think it's a wise decision to spend economically and get this for yourself.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,The best budget phone with no competiton; if you are lucky !!!,"Seriously, Motorola really has created the best affordable phone loaded with awesome features. 1. The build is good, back of the phone really feels good. 2. The 5"" display is crystal clear and very sharp. 3. Camera clicks extremely well photos in proper lighting. Even in low lights it manages well. 4. 1GB ram and Quad Core processor ensure that you don't irritated by slow speed. 5. Dual Sim functionality is good. You can use data on both sim cards. 6. Promised with Android L update. 7. Super in-call clarity. The volume is also loud during calls. 8. Gifted with two speakers with good loud sound. 9. 16GB internal memory plus external SD card supported.  All these make this phone nearly invincible and other phone companies would need to do some miracle to topple this giant down. At a price of Rs. 12,999/- this crushes competition. Some would say that there are the Mi3, Asus Zenfone 5, and upcoming Mi4, but none of these phones are readily available on flipkart and the buying procedure is also frustrating. Those who need a phone quick will surely go for this one.  Now an explanation for the second half of my review title: This phone no doubt can be bought eyes closed, but pray to god that you are not given a defective piece by the Flipkart/Motorola. Lot of reviews mention about the touch screen issues, camera issues, button issues etc. So these are the people who got unlucky and unfortunately received products with defects. Don't know what whether Flipkart or Motorola are going to do anything to avoid this in future. So if things work out 'all well' for you this phone is a gem. (I myself had some issues while inserting the sim card. It took lot of attempts of pressing the sim card in the slot available to get them finally 'clicked' in the right place)  Sadly this phone doesn't include a USB cable but supports USB. So you'll have to procure the USB cable on your own. One more disappointment is about the cost of the cases and covers available on Flipkart. Flipcover costs Rs.1700 and simple colourful back cover costs Rs. 800. This is too much of a cost. Flipkart users agree on this one. Hopefully they would reduce the price if they read the user reviews.  So in short, buy this phone no doubt, but your luck will determine whether you will enjoy this phone to the fullest or not.",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,1 star,Faulty set delivered.,"Used the phone for a couple of days. On the first day, the battery lasted for 7-8 hours on 3G with limited usage and harldy 1-2 apps installed. On the next day, the battery lasted for JUST above 5 hours and that too on 2G. How can a brand new phone with a 2070 mAh battery possibly drain so fast, and with hardly any apps installed. There seems to be a problem with network connectivity too when SIM slot 2 was used. I read the positive reviews. Looks like there isn't a problem with Moto G per se, because the battery has lasted upto 24 hours with mixed usage as per the reviews. The problem seems to be with the faulty set delivered to me. This has been the worst thing I have ever bought on Flipkart. Sad to say this, but I have lost my trust in Flipkart. Never before have I had to return an item, because Flipkart always delivered flawless items and on time too. But guess not anymore. I'd think a million times before buying something on this site again. Have filed for a return. Hope I get a replacement or at least a refund. Hope there are more negative reviews, so that Flipkart understands how important this issue is. Wish there was an option to give a negative rating. Feel disgusted to give even 1.",,Verified Purchase

I wish it was still 4.5 inch display, 5"" is just slightly too big for me, but it seems that is what everyone else wants.  Only I wish it had a bit more RAM. With 1 GB, if you have too many apps running, there is a noticeable lag, especially when you press the HOME button. Anyway, I deleted all the apps I don't need, and switched from GO Launcher to Nova Launcher, and things are working just fine.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,3 stars,Economy Phone,All Handset features Good in this budget. Using this handset for 1 week.  3 Cons: a) no Data Cable provided or guide / user manual to tell how to transfer data from Mobile to your PC/Laptop b) Battery charger heats up while charging and battery drains out quickly if Data or Location service is kept on. c) RAM of 1 GB could have been more to play games.  Hence would say its a average phone as per its price.   As a User need to spend extra money to buy: 1) micro SD card 2) Flip Cover 3) Screen Guard 4) Data cable,0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,Superb phone of this genre...,"The first impression of this phone is just WOW... The phone has a great sleek look.   Pros: 1) Superb camera clarity. Both Front and rear cameras.  2) The 1 GB RAM with snapdragon quad core processor is a good combo at this price. 3) Speed with WiFi connection is good. 4) Speaker quality is awesome. However, when you are on call it seems loud at times. Even when you are not on speaker it is very loud. You got to reduce the volume low so that others don't hear it out. 5) Music output is good. 6) Moto Assist (helps to chose a mode for ex: meeting, driving etc) and Moto Alert inbuilt apps are good.  Cons: Not much serious cons in this phone. Just to list a few: 1) Speaker seems loud when you are on call. 2) Taking a snapshot (screenshot) is not very easy ( you have to simultaneously hold power button and volume down). 3) Very few inbuilt (installed) apps available.  Overall it is a value for money phone in this segment. Motorola seems to be grabbing the market share from Samsung which is overpriced.",0 of 1 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,4 stars,"Great Phone , Everything about it is Just Perfect.","OK , First about Flipkart delivery : I paid 90 bucks extra for in a day delivery, Ordered the phone at 11 am , recieved it the next day at 8 pm . Bad service Flipkart, i might as well have got it the next day without paying 90 rs. And the guys who deliver, are shit, they don't know how to talk to people ,no etiquette at all.   Now about the Phone , Moto G 2nd gen is a brilliant phone , Everything about it is really good.  1. Build Quality and Looks : Sturdy build , nice matte black back cover, fits nicely on the hand with a good grip and Looks classy as well.  2.Display : Brilliant 5 inch screen, sunlight readability is good.  3.Android Version : 4.4.4. kitkat, Android L upgrade in November, what else do you need. 4.Speakers : Dual speakers in the front are a delight, load and clear. 5.Touch : Silky and smooth. 6.Ram and Processer : I am using more than 15 apps right now , and there isn't any Lag i can experience. 7. Battery : decent , will last about 12-14 hours or more is usage is less. 8. Camera : Rear cam is really good, the camera app doesn't have many options but a third party app can be installed for that , the clarity and shutter speed is really good. Front cam is so so good. 2 mp cam is really good for video calls and the odd selfie.  All in all a really good phone , cannot expect anything more for 13 grand. You can go for the Asus Zenphone 5 for 10 grand, but Moto will alwasy get the updates first, also , the battery life is better in Moto G, plus it is water resistant.  Yes , the charger and headphone quality is really cheap. Headphones aren't up to the mark , and the charger gets loosened while charging , resulting in heating up. Moto can improve on that.",0 of 1 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,A Bang for the Buck !!! A Winner All the way,I was using the Moto G(1) before and that as well as this new version the Moto G2 (XT1068) are simply a way of Motorola to tell other top makers (especially Samsung) that making a feature rich phone for the right price isn't that hard. Performance wise the phone is great at this price point.  All the games I played on this device are smooth and lag free with only 1 GB RAM unlike my previous Sammy (Samsung) phones which had 1GB or 1.5GB RAM and lagged or stuttered during normal day to day operations.  If you are interested in going for a good phone and can invest 13K then this is THE phone for you plus it comes from a trusted and experienced company like Motorola and yes this time Moto is offering timely software updates to it's phones which in my opinion is very critical. A good phone is a combination of good hardware specs and timely software updates as far as Android phones are concerned.  In this regard Microsoft has been pretty good with it's Lumia/Windows OS based phones.  What are you waiting for? Go ahead and buy the Moto G now!.,0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,3 stars,Moto G (2nd Gen) is a real saviour.,"After seeing the performance of Moto G 1st Gen in different aspects(gaming, smoothness and functionalities) i really liked that phone but due to lack in expandable storage have to think of other options. So i was on my way to opt for Xaomi Redmi 1S meanwhile Moto G 2nd Gen was launched soon i consulted my friend who was using Moto G he advised me to stick to Moto G 2nd Gen i have decided to order the same on the launch day itself. At first i got a defected piece in which SIM tray was damaged but it was later on replaced by Flipkart. One thing i would like to say that after reading the reviews of Redmi 1s i have no regrets about purchasing this phone. At this price point what Motorola offering is worth it. There are few cons which i would like to highlight other than that this deal is one of the best in class.  CONS 1. Headsets could have been improved. 2. Instead of providing a detachable charge they could have gone for a USB adapter and a micro-USB data cable.",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Battery- Lasted for a day with medium use. I do not play games. I watched full HD videos on it for about 30 mins. Other than that, no heavy use. Not so impressive but manageable. Display- IPS LCD 5 inch display is just awesome! compares to high end phones. Pixel density is a bit low than motog launched earlier, but it hardly makes a difference.

This phone counts better in literally every Benchmark scores than its predecessor. And unique feature is its STEREO SPEAKERS which lacks in most of high end smartphones. No other phone in this price range gives competition to this model. I definitely recommend this phone.",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,"Value for Money = Moto G""","Ordered this on the first day of launch. I was an admirer of Moto G 1st Gen, but the lack of extendable memory stopped me from owning it. The first thing I looked for in G2 was extendable memory. Saw that and ordered.. I know an impulse buy, but would proudly say not a foolish one. This is one great package by Moto.  The camera has been upgraded, the photo quality is quite good.  By far the catch has been the almost pure OS. Apart from 3 Moto apps (Alert-Security App; Assist-Moto version of profiles, but quite good one; Migrate-To pull all data from your old phone), which you are more prone to use, Motorola has been able to keep the essence of Kitkat OS intact on this model. The speakers do their job pretty decently. Tried with youtube and Google Play Music, and it is loud enough. With all the flagship mobiles around 35-40k, Moto will surely burn a hole in their share with such value products.",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,Awesome Phone at an Exceptionally affordable price,"First of all I want to say a big thanks to ""flipkart"" for bringing back Motorola to India (say reintroduce). I was a big fan of Motorola. So was waiting for a new Motorola product. And then flipkart stepped in and bought the moto generation.   This phone (moto g- 2 gen) is an awesome phone. 5"" inches display and a 8MP camera with a flash and a 1 GB ram with internal memory of 16GB, anything else you want in a phone worth less than 13000/-??? Amazed by the performance of the product. Awesome sound quality and a good picture quality. And loved the gaming experience, just downloaded NFS and the experience- am loving it.   Would suggest others to buys this phone.  8MP camera 2MP front camera 1GB Ram 5"" display Awesome Sound What else do you want in a price tag of less than 13000.

Where I paid for both phones regardless of same id . They took money for 2 phones and gave me 1 offer only.  Shame on you Flipkart and I protest your monopoly for Motorola product.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,4 stars,Excellent delivery speed and quality product!!!,"Was a little apprehensive ordering a phone for the first time online. Actually I did find mixed reviews online and even in the consumer complaint forums there were bad experiences. But I should say I had a great and a very positive experience. Ordered my phone on Sunday midnight and it was delivered on Tuesday morning, that's actually pretty fast and cool. I was able to check whether it had reached my local city hub and at wat time.... They messaged me the delivery persons number and name once it was dispatched from the hub...... Ultimately I could track my order every step..... Finally though I wasn't home my relation picked it up and her name was sent to me as soon as she received it.....   Still was a little apprehensive about whether packing was good or whether product was damaged. But once I got home, the packing was superb and product was brand new.... So completely relieved.

Thanks to Flipkart and his team.  And coming to device Moto G (2nd Gen 2014).  I have used this new Moto G (2nd Gen 2014) for more than 10 days now.  In one word I feel this phone is very smooth and premium.  Many people think that this 5 inc phone does have good battery life with 2070 mAH, I personally tested this phone with 96% charge and you know it was lasted for 2 days and even after 2 full days there was 22 % juice left over it. I have kept brightness in auto mode. Took more than 50 photos and I had play videos and music for 90 min. I personally did not find any issues with battery. It will surly come for more than a full day even if you are heavy game and music player. And you know ""qualcom snapdragan quadcore processor"" helps to improve the battery life.  And coming to camera it was very good in day light and snaps are taken without any delay. I am very happy with Camera performance.  And coming to gaming it was amazing very smooth and lucid no lags at all, thanks to ""qualcom snapdragan quadcore processor"".   Phone build and quality are awesome believe me you don't get this kind of quality phone from china phone makes. In 10 days more 20 mins it was fell down form my daughter hands nothings was happened( I did not have any flip cover & screen guard and I don't think this phone requires these things as covers with gorilla glass 3 and premium build).

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,Strongly recommended,"I recommend this phone for multiple reasons but the primary being the OS and stock andriod experience. I am a gadget freak and have used andriod phones from froyo to 4.4.4 . As my wife took away my nexus 5, i was handicapped and was using Micromax canvas HD. This phone, compared to A116, is similar in processor and ram. What is distinct is the pure andriod experience. I have been using this phone for over a week now and have not felt that any compromising element , when compared to Nexus 5. The screen size is very well designed (bezel region) .  The dual sim usage was a bit painful in my previous dual sim phone. But , here you can turn off the dual sim option and/or make one sim primary for all your usage (call / message etc). the 2014 version comes with option to add additional memory (terrific).   The only area which i personally did not like is the rear of the phone is not flat but curved. I was used to Nexus 5 with flat rear. But i am sure i will get used to this phone in few days. The box doesnt include USB cable to connect between computer and phone. Charger is a bit bulky and i dont like the white color of the chargers.   Overall , i suggest go for this phone if you are brand conscious and lover of pure andriod.",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase
Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,Truly Exceptional!!!,"Hi, I am writing this review after using the phone from past 5 days. As the name goes, this indeed an exceptional phone with exceptional price..  Let's see some important features of this phone without any mentions of specifications as it is known already.  Photosphere: Yes, this phone is having gyroscope sensor. Just download the Google Camera App from Play store, start shooting the panoramic and photosphere snaps and share on Google+. And enjoy the 360 degrees of viewing experience.  Google Now: Officially Google says that OK Google cannot be launched from any screen or lock screen in Moto G. But if the language is changed to English [US}, these option are indeed available in the phone. I experienced some glitches while launching GNow from any screen but later I reset the ph to factory settings and now it works... Launch GNow from any screen and do whatever u want by just speaking to the ph!!!  Software: Ph comes with the pure android Kitkat 4.4.4 without bloatware which makes the ph buttery smooth and fast. Most importantly, Motorola assures of definitive upgrade to Android L as soon as it is available. Apps like Moto Assist [which uses more battery], Moto Alert and Moto Migrate are quite useful.  Battery Charging time: This is a Con. It took almost 3 and half hours to charge from 10% to 100% with the charger supplied with the phone.. I will suggest to charge the ph with Samsung Charger which will bring down the charging time by at least 40-50 mins.  Screen and Sound : With 5 inches and 720p resolution, watch HD videos with great clarity. Two front facing speakers give enough sound output and voice clarity during ph calls.  If you are looking for value for money, just go for it....",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase
Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,Stock Android Experience !!,"Got this device few days ago !! I had Samsung earlier and was frustrated from the lagging of the OS because of the heavy bloatware and the UI Skin... I made up my mind to go for a Stock Android experience. I waited for Android One but was somehow disappointed that they considered only the Entry Level devices, so my search stopped at Moto G 2nd Gen.  Although it has got ""soon to be obsolete"" Snapdragon processor but then its still good to run a stock kitkat as it works on lower specs that JB. So its still snappier and the ""Aesthetics of Stock Android"" is just lovely. I am completely enjoying the KitKat taste and they have mentioned that this phone will be getting Android L as well makes it even more worthy.  Coming to the battery, I know they have not done good as far as battery is concerned !! They have increased the size of the screen by retaining the same battery. I dont play games on my phone but mainly uses for IM or Social Media connectivity which is pretty good and open without lag.   All in all a good phone...

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,4 stars,Care for it like you would your baby,"The phone is good no doubt a good buy, but........  For one, a phone that parades itself as 2nd Gen, they ship a shitty cheap charger with it. No USB cable charger that even the Asus Zenphone4 provides even though its less than half the price. So you end up chucking the Moto charger as use a USB one because your laptop, emergency pack and car all are geared to charge your through an USB cable. Pity really by Moto.  Now for the care part, I am one of the unfortunate guys who dropped his one the second day it came. The screen immediately cracked to the extent that reading is a pain, although the phone is still working. Now when I called the Service centre, the one in Lajpat Nagar, they told me that the phones just launched, how can you expect us to have spares for it. We have screens for the 1st Gen Moto G (like that really helps me), but call us back in a week and maybe we'll have it then.  So here I am, with a 2nd Gen phone, with a shitty charger, a completely cracked screen and at the mercy of Moto that hopefully once they finish their sale of phones, they might look to after sales service and maybe I'll get my screen changed.   However, like I said in the beginning, it is a great phone, from all by 14 hours of use!!!",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

When I got the phone there was a dead pixel in it and I placed a replace request and I have been waiting since 10 days for the issue to get resolved. Flipkart has the worst customer care. So think before you order anything from this network.  I have decided not to buy any product from Flipkart anymore.,,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,4 stars,Not Good Not Bad. Its good phone,"Well Its not as good as i expected from this phone. As it is shown and shown on line it looks great phone. But after Receiving it and going through all the functions and operations I found that it lags certain features as mentioned below: (1) There is no File Explorer available with it. Motorola should upgrade it as soon as possible (2) We are not able to customize Icons as per our requirement. I think Motorola should provide this feature so that user can organize according to their wish. (3) Headphone Provided is not good quality and seems problem in voice disturbance while talking with it. I think Speaker of Headphone should be modified as soon as possible as current design is not good to fit in ears and makes feel uncomfortable. (4) More Shortcuts should be provided in shortcut menu. (5) More widgets should be provided which are common to use like LED Light Torch, Dual Clock  More customer will be happy if above mentioned suggestions will be implemented by Motorola.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,Excellent Phone..5 reasons to buy Moto G(2nd Gen),"Dear friends I have been using the handset since 1 week and I will give you my honest opinion about why I selected Moto G(2nd gen) over other phones.   1. Brand name: Although you can buy Indian brands like micromax, karbonn and others with much higher specs in this price tag but the Motorola brand name is certainly bigger than these brands. Samsung & Sony are always overpriced to specs they offer.  2. Build Quality & looks: Excellent build quality, very sturdy phone & looks and feels very premium.   3. Brilliant display: HD display is vibrant and superb.  4. Stock Android & latest version: User friendly UI & latest version. Guaranteed update to android L.  5. Camera: camera quality is very good particularly in HDR mode. Its nice for regular photography.  This is my opinion based on my judgement and use. Frankly I also tried for Xiaomi Mi3 but this phone is difficult to get and I am not sure about the durability and also the brand name is least known in India.  hope my review is useful.",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,A brilliant phone with great media performance,"A super upgrade to a previous market trend setter. Using it for a week now and very satisfied. Look wise it is quite stunning with a curved back and feels very comfortable in hand. Although the ppi has reduced due to same screen resolution in a 5 inch display, it doesn't make that much of difference in naked eye. Sporting a full 720p HD display with front facing dual speakers it offers brilliant media performance. The UI is not so stylish customized one, but the stock android UI is super lag free and easy to use.  Performance wise it is quite good and running high graphics demanding games are not really a concern. Also the device doesn't heat up.  One can argue about the battery backup, but in my opinion it offers enough.  Expandable memory card slot means one of the biggest cons of its predecessor has been taken care of.  The only real con of this device is the camera quality, cause even after upgrading to 8 MP it still nowhere near the best. And the default camera app is also disappointing. Better install any other camera app. The earphone in the package is also very cheap in quality. In 13k its total value for money. The only real competitor is MI3 which is really a better device. But good luck in getting that. Other alternative could be Zenfone 5 and Canvas Nitro. Zenfone 5 yet to get its Kitkat upadate. Micromax has its problems in fragile screen and rapid depleting battery. Also a guaranteed android L update means it has a cutting edge over its rival.",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,"Awesome phone. Battery doesn't suck, Good camera.","I bought this phone from Flipkart. I am using this phone for a week now.  The phone has a 5 inch screen which is good and people don't worry about pixel density, you won't notice. The UI is raw and is very fast, no lag whatsoever. The camera is great though the inbuilt app sucks.  Don't complain about the 1 GB ram, it somehow manages to run games and allows multitasking without any lag.  The battery is not bad, it lasts a day on average usage, What more do you expect ? (WIFI on, DATA on, little gaming, HD vidoes, a few voice calls). People go to developer setting and change the runtime from dalvik to ART, it improves battery life.  I travelled on a road trip of 150 Kms. I started with 40% juice. Made a few calls on the way, checked the map using GPS twice but I quickly closed the app and turned location access off to save battery. I even sent a few messages using whatsapp and took 20 to 30 photos. I travelled through the hills and the carrier signal was spotty. I was able to return home with 20% juice left. Dalvik sucks go with ART. Battery drains very little on standby when you use ART. Sometimes you think that the battery meter is wrong because it stays the same for over a hour if the phone is in standby, true believe me.   The phone is not small enough to work with one hand and not large enough to work with both hands. It takes a while to use the phone with one hand, many thanks to the MOTO-dent on the backside. Overall a very decent phone with awesome built quality for such a price.",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,4 stars,A Great mid-range smartphone!,"I got a manufactured defect in the speakers.But thanks to Flipkart got it replaced :)  The phone is cool.Can multi-task with ease has great functions like moto migrate etc.   But a great flaw! is that in my 2 new Moto G (2nd gen) phones,the ram used out of 1 Gb is always more than 60% on restart.That means the phone will always use minimum 550-600 Mb of RAM out of 1 Gig.  There is not much garbage except 2-3 pre loaded feature apps.The android is pure stock one with all google apps.  The phones camera is not pretty good but as compared to all those phones out at this range in 8mp its good.A camera with 13mp would have been a treat!  Battery life is average.But you will sure need to charge it each night.  I like the phone on most aspects.But for screen - It is not as clear as prev. moto g.The resolution being same on a bigger screen is not done moto!   The phone feels light(149 gm) in hand because of its broader body.The phone is much more handy than the prev. gen.  Moto-G is an average gaming phone.It runs little games like temple run 2 with ease but lags with some big games like Thor ,Iron man etc.For die-hard gamers its a No!  The phones FM Radio is very very disappointing.First of all it never caught any actual frequencies in my area.second we cannot add frequencies through keyboard so setting frequencies using that little line is a hectic task.Even the headphones are of damn low quality this was not expected. There is NO Loudspeaker for the FM Radio! Hope motorola will resolve these issues with an Fm radio update.  Also i don't know why but the phone's screen gaurd that comes applied is very cheap in quality.It got so many scratches only after 2-3 days of delicate use.Just in spare pockets the phone's screen gaurd gets scratches(not the screen) which is ridiculous! Plz buy a flip cover to protect the screen.  One more thing is that the accessories like i.e headphones and charger smell very bad,just like some cheap plastic.The phones audio jack and the charging slot also bear the same plasticky smell ! There is no data cable along with the phone so better manage with some other phones data cable.  Thanks for reading :) Happy Flipkarting!",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,4 stars,Good Phone,"This is one is a good handset and even beats on my Xperia Z on the performance and smoothness, the only dissappointing factor is the 1 GB RAM which would have been minimum 2 GB RAM, with all such enhancement made to this charming phone, the RAM is only at par with MOTO E and the people who select MOTO G is obviously expecting and having more multi tasking functions for sure. I opted this one instead of Micromax Nitro which is having the best tech spec so far in this range (ignoring MI phone), is for the build quality and service support (hope so) though i do have a good remarks about all micromax products especially at their CANVAS models.   Besides this i found no unhappy factor so far and would suggest anyone to go ahead with product with eyes closed ;-)  Giving rating 4 because of the 1 GB RAM limitation",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

I chose this over Micromax Nitro and of course its better choice.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,4 stars,A decent and affordable smartphone,"Moto G (2nd Gen) phone's most important feature I would say is brilliant ergonomic design. The 5 in screen is big enough, crisp and can be easily handled with single hand. Also Motorola has improved at some of the shortcomings of 1st gen Moto G. There is a provision for Micro SD card, so together with 16 gb internal memory this phone is now a powerhouse. Camera MP count as well as overall quality is better. Qualcomm snapdragon quad core chipset is quite of a performer and playing games on this one is enjoyable. On the battery front, Motorola could have increased battery capacity but 2070 mAh still gives reasonable backup.",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase
Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,4 stars,Worthy for your hard earned money,"Moto g 2nd gen awesome phone for your money.  -Actually it was hardly 20 days since i had bought moto g 1st gen, now 2nd gen got released and i was freaking jealous and went crazy, bought the 2nd gen as well. -The phone looks cool with the large screen and big looks which might be little irritating to keep in your pocket. -Touch seems not so sensitive as 1st gen or i haven't removed the screen wrapper due to that it might be. -Processor seems speed enough and cam is good to click on the go. -For gamers like me big screen is an added advantage. -Moto might have compromised with the hardware material quality to get the weight reduced cos 2nd gen is a lot more light that 1st gen and low in hardware quality compared. -Multi tasking is good enough to handle many tasks. -Expandable memory is added advantage. -Apart from paying 13k moto wont even provide a data cable which i felt bad.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,4 stars,Nice and durable phone (Gionee-M2 vs Moto G (2nd Gen))...,"Service of flipkart is nice and prompt, 5 stars for that.  I'm using this phone since a week, earlier I was using Gionee M2 so here is the comparison.  1. Battery of Gionee-M2 is 4200MH so no use of comparison. Still, Moto G(2nd gen) battery is lasting for some 18-20 hours with normal calling, some 3-4 hrs video, 1-2 hr surfing and video calling. So for me, its a win-win for both devices. 2. Display and picture quality of M2 is much better than Moto G(2nd gen) so undoubtedly its a win for Gionee M2 3. I do not see any difference in performance, both are equally good. So again a win-win. 4. Looks wise I find Moto-G better than M2. Also, marathon battery of M2 itself is bigger than some feature phones so M2 is much heavier than Moto-G. So its a win for Moto-G. 5. Sounds of Moto-G Dual speaker and M2 Single speaker are same, so for me its a win of M2.  6. Earphone and charger provided with M2 is much better than Moto-G, also the factory packing of M2 is much better and safe than of Moto-G. Flipcart should also pack the device carefully in their box like Amazon's to avoid any accidental damages. M2 wins again. 7. I find camera quality of 8MP Moto-G better than 8MP M2. I also tried it on some moving objects and found Moto-G better. So, a win for Moto-G 8. Gorilla glass of Moto-G is undoubtedly a Win. 9. Moto-G 1st Gen was almost water resistant (videos available on youtube) so I guess 2ng Gen should also have similar quality. 10. One of my friend (B*****d) had dropped my M2 from 5 ft height but my phone was not damaged at all. This really increased my faith in Chinese mobiles. I do not want to test my Moto G(2nd gen) but I'm sure it is better than M2. 11. M2 does not have a led notification, Moto-G does not have Torch and Speaker mode for FM. 12. M2 costs Rs.10,300/-, Moto-G (2nd Gen) costs Rs.12999/- Whatever I have written above is purely my observation on my purchased devices and other people may have different opinions on their devices.",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,Moto does it again!,"The 2nd Gen is as good as it gets. Motorola was indeed listening and has brought out a phone which fills in the so-called gaps that were felt by users / critics / et.al. for the 1st Gen phone. I actually own a 1st Gen, had bought it the day of the release, and now bought this one for my wife, again on the night of the release itself. Which goes to show the admiration that I have for the phone and the company too!  Great work again by FlipKart!! U guys just amaze me each time :) Wonderful packaging, ultra fast delivery!! Cheers!!  About the phone: From my initial impressions, which are almost a week old now, this one kind of puts the Nexus's in a little jitter.  Reasons are pretty obvious -  - 8MP rear cam, 2MP front cam,  - Quad-core processor,  - Stereo speakers which are awesome!,  - 5"" screen with 720p resolution, which is again awesome!  - microSD card slot, this was a big miss in the 1st Gen, although I am still happy with the 16GB that I have with the older one. - 16GB built in space! What more do you need along with an expandable mmc slot !! - Water proofing (this works because I have had experiences with my 2013 moto g where the phone was fully wet coz of rains and when I took it out from my pocket it was water everywhere and I could swipe the phone, make phone calls, read sms's, etc. with a wet finger and the phone was working like a charm) - Almost Stock android (4.4.4) which makes you think twice about spending double the money or triple for a Sam / Son! - The default launcher is good, which is on the lines of the Google Now Launcher. Also, the Google Now Launcher can be installed with ease now, thanks to 4.4.4 - Motorola Assist and Alert are two great apps that one should just have! The phone can be used virtually by talking to it !! Great job Moto!! - Solid build. Although the 5"" screen makes the phone a tad bigger to hold, but it feels comfy given the curvy back which sinks the phone in your palms with ease. - Battery life: Goes for a day with full Wi-Fi. People who say that it is not good on the charge when 3G / 2G networks are in use, then guys this is a fact. 3G will suck the life out of a battery on any given device! In fact the same happens if the location services are set to 'High Accuracy' too... so yes, it's something that we cannot do anything about, but from my experience of a 4.4.2 and 4.4.4, the battery life has become better and will get better with the incoming Android ""L"". So be patient and Moto G should get that update!  I'd say, if you can spend 13k and get an experience which will make the neighbours envy, then yes this is the phone to go for!!",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,4 stars,Brand with VFM | Kudos to Flipkart for replacing the defected piece without hassle.,"I loved it when I first saw it and I bought it for my wife on the very first day it was launched. But unfortunately the handset I received started showing a weird issue with screen after charging it for the first time. But nevertheless Flipkart has replaced it with a smooth process and the new one is performing great. Screen and graphics are really good. Its responsive and vibrant in colors. Performance wise its really fast, no lags until now. Battery backup is decent but could have been little more powerful for a better support to 5"" display (reducing 1 star for that :) ). Expandable memory is a big plus. The best thing I liked about the phone is front facing speaker combo. It enriches the media experience and the variety of colors available in *original* back covers is really nice to have. There are so many phone available in the market with better features but if you can get a Brand which is quite light on your pocket then it will make to more happier and feel much satisfactory.",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

I would rate this phone as ""Good"", NOT ""Excellent/Amazing"". Below are the pros and cons of the phone -  Pros - 1. MotoMigrate - I was really impressed by this app from Motorola. Made life a lot simpler to migrate stuff from my old phone to my new phone. 2. Camera - The picture quality is good. Speed is not too bad either. It has a definite improvement over its predecessor in terms of low light images. 3. Speed/Performance - I'm not a gaming freak. Have been mostly using messaging/social networking apps on the phone. Performance seems to be good for this usage.  Cons - 1. Battery - The battery life seems to be an issue. It has not lasted even a day(16 hrs) @ times with mobile data/location services switched on. 2. Build - The quality of the back cover feels very cheap. Could have been better.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,A worthy successor to Moto G,"Before I say about Moto G 2nd generation I like to tell you that i have been using smart phones for last three years.My both previous phones were Samsung.After my last smartphone Samsung Galaxy Grand died using for 1 year 4 months I started looking for suitable replacement for it. I decided to downgrade my budget at not more than Rs15000/- and a suitable upgrade within that amount.I narrowed down on Moto G due to the following features a good cpu combined with 1gb of ram, 5 inch screen with good display, gorilla glass 3, 16gb internal memory upgradable via sd card to 32gb and above all Kitakat 4.4.4 which no other flagship big brands are providing. Further there is no doubt that Motorola is a reputed brand and one can rely on it. I placed the order on September 5th 2014 at 12am and got delivery on 9th so it is nearly 6 days i am using the phone without any problems.The battery standby is nice it lasts 24 hours after full charge with 3 g net always on as I never switch off mobile data.Network connectivity is good no call drops i use vodafone for voice and reliance for 3g data.I also share my bb internet via WIFI for some time in a day.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,Awesome phone for the price (lets leave xiaomi mi3 out :P),"Hey everyone, I had ordered the Moto G 2nd Gen on 13th Sep 2014 and I got it on 14th Sep 2014. Thanks to WS Retail and Flipkart.  The Packing was very good. I was scared that the phone would be defective.. luckily it wasn't.  I had a budget of 15k to buy a smartphone and obviously my first choice was Xiaomi mi3. I waited for two weeks but the mi3 was never back on sale.  My next option was Moto G. I was really worried about the battery because too many ppl have said that the battery is not good. I did not have any choice and hence placed the order for Moto G praying that the battery should be decent if not great.  I have used the phone for more than 30 hours. The battery is really more than adequate. It will last for an entire day even after extensive usage.  I have read a review where someone complained about the battery getting drained faster when GPS was on, well I haven't tested that yet. So apart from that you need not have to worry about the battery at all.  Display is really beautiful.  The build quality is good.  Performance is really great for a budget smartphone.  Camera is good. It could have been better. Watching videos and playing games will be a delight on this phone, thanks to the display and speakers. I have installed and played Smash hit and Vector games and it was very smooth. Zero lag.  So overall, the phone is bang for the buck. One added advantage is that we'll get Android L update.  My suggestion for ppl looking to buy a phone within 15k will definitely be Moto G 2nd Gen.",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,4 stars,Totally worth it !!!,"Writiting this review after using the device for one week.  Considering the price, I would say, this for sure is a value a money product. As a budget buy it satisfies all the needs.   Considering the two speakers, sound quality is good (the jack on the device could have been better), in call voice is also good, screen reso and brightness are decent enough, camera is also good (including the flash).  The OS (kitkat) is smooth and line up for the next update hits well.  Cons: 1. Not very powerful, multitasking needs to be done judiciously, else reboot required. Because of its 1.2Ghz. processor it cannot carry much weight. Managable though. 2. Jack could have been better. Have issues in inserting a speaker/ earphone jack!

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,4 stars,2,"Thanks for the replacement and the new set is working fine. The response time was fabulou. I would like to tell the readers that Flipkart has brought a new trend in trading or purchase. In normal circumstance if i would had problem in hanset i should have found a service centre and taken there for repair or replacement and the time taken for the same we donot know. the travel, one or two day off etc.... Thanks for your prompt service and what else now the rating goes to 4 as promised.  Old report:Issue with camera and receiving calls. Every time camera is switched on it is saying close the application and not ale to take single snap till date. With respect to receiving calls in a day iam finding that the caller is able to hear our conversation but as a reciver we are not able to hear the conversation from other side and once we switch off the handset and again swith on it will be okay but this has to be done 3-4 times in a day, Frustrating and cant understand why FlipKart has not checked on product before it is being marketed in their Site. if there is no quality check dept in Motorola and FlipKart then these type of issues will make customer think twice to buy any new product. clear the issue i will rate 4 for the same",,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,Awesome Mobile,"I was using Samsung Grand Duos previously. I bought Moto G 5 Days before and started using it. When i am comparing it with my old mobile it is just awesome. I found following result after comparing Moto G (2nd Gen.) with Samsung Grand Duos.  Proc: 1. Less price while comparing with features 2. Good Display Quality. with 5"" screen it shows far better colors than Samsung Grand Duos. 3. Attractive Design, Easy to handle.  4. Not a single unnecessary app in this mobile while Samsung gives many unnecessary apps their mobiles. 5. Good Sound Quality.  Conc:  1. While comparing with Samsung Grand, there is no option for Grand's Photo Picture Quality. here Grand wins race against Moto G. 2. Attached battery. Non-removable battery. 3. Memory expanded up-to only 32 GB.  But Overall Moto G (2nd Gen.) mobile is the best mobile in price range Rs (12000-18000).",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase
Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,3 stars,Not as good as older sibling,"This phone is not as great as older sibling, here are some pros and cons.  Pros: * Bumped up rear and front camera to 8 and 2 megapixels. (Takes hell better snaps than MI3. I returned mine because was facing issues and bought this.) * SD card slot. * Bigger Screen * LOUD Front Speakers provides fantastic audio and call quality, your neighbor can hear too.   Cons: * Same battery capacity as earlier G. Phone lasts only 12 hours with full charge. * Pathetic charging time. Takes around 4 hours to charge. * Only 289 PPI as compared to 329 PPI on the previous G. Icons look more crisp on the previous version.  It would have been a killer with an increased CPU maybe to 1.6 Ghz...i.e. the one on Redmi 1S, also RAM could have been bumped to 1.5 GB.....battery could have been bigger given the screen size.  Price point is lucrative but people wouldn't have cribbed had the price been around 15K with above features included.",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

At first I though to use this as my secondary phone to compliment my S4 in daily use, however just after 2 days It has became my primary phone. It is totally lag free and at times i notice it responding to the commands better than S4 for that matter.  I still believe the camera is below par and i was shocked I find there is no zoom option. Even I tried Google Native Camera App still the same result.  In the last I am able to manage a day and half battery back up which is way more than my expectations.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,Awesome product by motorola,"I have not started using it yet (waiting to get my sim converted to micro sim). However the product looks nice, it has a solid build quality, and a decent camera. 2 MP front camera is sufficient for selfies.  Gaming experience is good, I never faced any lag on this phone.  It also support ART (switch from Dalvik to ART), which is not supported on stock Nexus 7 tab, however the phone is already blazing fast, so I didn't feel the need to switch to ART.  Motorola Migrate is awesome app, worked absolutely perfect to transfer contacts, sms and call logs from old phone to new phone (it also supports audio, video and pictures) .  I had a very bad experience with flipkart delivery system. I ordered the phone on Saturday (6th September), and it was shipped by the seller ""WS Retail"" in few hours but flipkart took 6 days to deliver the product (it was delivered on 11th September).

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,A very good bargain at this price,"I ordered Moto G 2nd gen on 7th and got the phone on 10th. Quick delivery as expected from flipkart. As i was busy in my business work could get my hands on phone only on 13th evening. So experimented with phone over weekend.   1) Packing was not that impressing but seeing that complete phone box was packed inside flipkart box. it is acceptable.  2) A bit of disappointment for not having USB cable with charger. But for this price range it was somewhat expected.  3) Overall phone looks impressive. Switched it on and put on charging. Everything was fine. I read most of the reviews regarding charger heating up and phone heating up during charging. But fortunately nothing of this sort happened with my set.  4) Put the SIM and SD card from old Samsung infuse 4G and both were accepted without any issue. After some time msg came that SD card is unmounted unexpectedly. Removed and again put the card but same happened again. Googled on net and found that sometimes this issue resolves if u format the card. Took backup and format the card. Issue resolved. :)  5) Front camera is too good... Rear camera also works great outdoor and so so in dim light.  6) Wi-fi, GPS, GPRS, 3G all worked pretty well without any issue.   7) It has two speakers and sound quality is above average. Slight issues on high bass music but comparatively much better. Stereo effects are clearly audible ( after a long time heard stereo on mobile speakers).  8) Voice quality of conversation is also clear and loud. I had to reduce the conversation volume as it was audible to other persons in the room without putting it on speaker. Speaker phone also works well.  9) I am not a avid game player but speed of the phone, graphics and few games were running quite well and smoothly.  So far so good .. now for the drawbacks   1) Very disappointing thing is that this phone has the minimum customization options i have ever seen on android phone. I thought it is from google and and android is also from google so it will have much better customization. but it disappoints.  At least, Silent mode, Rotation lock and Restart in power menu are minimum required customization. Customization of top drawer by user is another desirable feature, if Motorola can add.  2) Earphone provided with the set are not as much impressive as the phone. I think cost cutting is done there.  3) Another issue in long run is the battery backup. At this stage (new phone) battery backup is just OK. it should have been better with 5 inch screen.  I have not used earlier Moto-G (it became out of stock on the very first day) so cannot compare with that but over all a good bargain at this price and a good piece of smart phone.  A good buy and cost effective solution .. :))",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,4 stars,"Gen 2, bigger better!","Ordered the phone he moment it went on sale at 12pm. Was delivered within 3 days which is not bad at all, but FK has spoilt us with quicker deliveries. Coming to the phone, it feels more premium than its predecessor. The bigger size looks and feels good and even fits well in the hands enabling easy single handed operation. I haven't loaded the phone yet, but Android 4.4.4 version that comes loaded in the phone works fuss free and is quite smooth. Although hardware remains the same even for the bigger 5 inch screen, the display is still quite crisp (unless you compare to an S5 or an iPhone 5 which would be kinda lame).  I needed a decent camera that could shoot reasonable well in low light. 8 MP is the norm with most phones and the G2 boasts the same now. Picture quality is good in good light and a tad bit noisy in low light which is understandable for the camera specs the phone packs.   I tried in vain to get the MI3 before i got the G2. But im hoping i made the right decision. Time will tell.   PS: make sure u order the scratch guard and a cover with the phone as none of the accessories are available off the shelf.",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Phone is best in its price range, has good built quality and easy to handle.  Its pure android 4.4.4 kitkat (latest) its very fast with booting up, finding and connecting to wifi etc.  It has 2 Good front speakers - its loud and clear. Good for gaming and entertainment. Mine is 16GB version - so i can install many apps , this also has external storage support upto 32GB. I can move apps to SD card.  It has got OTG - you can connect pendrive.  The phone is 5 inch HD and gives very good display - Can watch HD videos without issues.  Its lot better than other phones in this price range.  Never experienced any lag, very free flowing menus and apps.  Currently playing real racing 3 - the game loads easily and can play smoothly. Need to try some more...   RAM is 1 GB out of which always you can see 200-300 MB free even while multiple apps are open - which is good.   Front and rear Camera is good. Also has good flash.Takes good quality pictures.  Battery could be better, Fully charged - it gives 7-8 hours with 3G network and internet usage (always online on Whats app, facebook, checking emails etc) and normal call usage. If you play games for 30 minutes- Phone gets hot.But that's normally the case with most of the phones.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,Another killer moto phone,"Motorola has outdone itself once again, seeing the increasing competition in the price range of the moto g, with asus and micromax and others releasing their own powerhouses, Motorola decided to upgrage the moto g to the second gen, and in my opinion, it does enough to inch ahead of the competition a little bit. Its got a better camera, its handles a bit better and is a little faster, gaming is good but higher end games falter, doesnt feel too bulky in your hand and looks fantastic.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,Worth the price you pay,"Firstly, Flipkart's service was as usual super quick, and the package was well covered and protected. I placed the one day delivery order for this product and sure enough, I received the phone the very next day, unscratched.  As for the phone itself, here is my review:  PROS: 1) Feels light. 2) Doesn't feel like cheap plastic and feels sturdy in the hands, and doesn't just slip away. 3) It looks like a premium product! 4) 5"" display does look gorgeous on the phone. 5) Doesn't take too long to boot up. 6) Network detection is quick. 7) Ships pre-loaded with the latest Android Kitkat 4.4.4 OS. 8) WiFi and Bluetooth work without any glitches. In fact, WiFi works better than on my iPhone 5! 9) Touch sensitivity is amazing. 10) Once the phone is on the home-screen, it works smooth - non-glitchy. 11) 8 MP main camera (aperture = f/2.0!!) and 2 MP front camera combo - very good image quality, and the flash works like a charm, producing very close to original colors, unlike what I've seen on other expensive smart phones. 12) Memory card slot is a welcome feature, and works well - up to 32 GB. 13) Supports battery charging through computer. 14) Doesn't produce too much heat even with prolonged camera usage / image editing (haven't run any graphic hungry games on it yet) 15) Stereo speakers and Dual Mic for better hearing experience and communication. 15) 13k INR on this handset is a spend totally worth it!  CONS: 1) Mediocre battery - comes with a non-removable Li-Ion 2070 mAh battery. Maximum battery life of 1 day with normal usage (calls, messaging, and facebook or music). 2) Battery charging time is long 3) NO USB Cable provided in the box; only the power adapter and a pair of headphones (not of great quality). 4) Sometimes behaves as if it ran out of free memory on RAM, but only for a second; especially after you use the camera and do a graphic and memory hungry operation such as rendering images while trying to edit your pics, etc. 5) Applications crash, but that's probably got something to do with Apps and Kitkat updates. 6) Camera app could be better, with a few more options (nothing a few camera apps cannot fix) 7) Kitkat may be a bad update from Android so far. There's some amount of restrictions to move data from the phone memory to the memory card. It only allows Images and Videos, mostly. 8) No LTE (4G) - only 3G Internet possible (cannot expect more for 13k IMO). 9) Home screen icons are large, and Kitkat has no option to customize it (which forces us to use a 3rd party launcher that gives us the ability to customize home screen and notification area) 10) The power and volume buttons don't feel robust, and sometimes when you press them, they give you the feeling that they are about to give up on you. 11) Earpiece could be troublesome on a few of these phones, sometimes producing static like sound while on call.  Conclusion: If your budget is under 15k and are looking for a great smart phone, this should be it! Worth every penny.",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Here is the detailed review..  Pros:- -Superb HD display and large screen..  -Build Quality is simply Great..Phone doesn't look cheap at all and can make many high end flagship devices run for their money..  -Stock android and latest android kitkat 4.4.4. which makes the device superfast backed up by some Decent hardware..  -Gaming Performace of the device is also great..I have tried so many graphic intensive apps like asphalt 8, real racing 3 etc.. and all of them work quite well without lagging a single bit..  -Camera of the device is also great and photos are quite clear..And specially 2MP front cam is far more good than many other branded devices having 5MP front Cam..  -Two front speakers give some good Stereo Sound..Also call quality is quite decent..   Cons:- -Quality of lock and volume buttons is kind of average but its not much of an issue and it couls hav been better..  -Charging Adapter is not seperated by a usb cable and So u hav to buy a seperate Usb cable or use one from your old phones if you had any..!!  -Also the build quality and comfort level of headphones provided with the device are average.. But i must appreciate the fact that the thing i hav been searching for from so many latest headphones these days is finally provided by Motorolla..

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,1 star,MOST PATHETIC DELIVERY SERVICE ON THE PLANET !!!,"I ordered a moto g on 7th Sep and was assured it will be delivered by 12th Sep. On 12th after i called Flipkart i got to know my order has been cancelled due to some problem with Flipkarts delivery service guys and i was asked to reorder the phone and they assured me i will get the phone by 17th Sep. Now i have been following up everyday with Flipkart whether the Moto G will be delivered to my address or not and everyday they kept assuring me that the phone will be delivered. And now as i suspected, my order has been cancelled again by Flipkart and they say my area is under NO SERVICE ZONE. I am from Navi Mumbai and i have ordered a million things from other e commerce websites and never has the delivery been delayed and now i order a phone from Flipkart, bcoz they have exclusive distribution rights, and they cant deliver it. Kindly use some of the money u guys make to improve ur logistics and transportation. And for gods sake hire a better courier service which services all areas. Had Flipkart not been the exclusive distributor, i would have never purchased anything from this site ever again. This 1 star is for the Flipkart support staff.Who are humble and speak very politely but dont know anything wats going onand whether the product will be delivered or not.",,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,Exceptional price.....Exceptional phone,"Could'nt have asked for more by just paying Rs.12,999. It is a very well rounded product. It basically does most things very well. I have just used this for about a week now and am loving it. This is what I think. Pros: 1. 5 inch 720p screen. A big screen, great for gaming, reading, typing etc. 2. Quad core processor. Little or no lag. 3. Vanilla android kitkat(4.4.4. i.e. the latest update). Very aesthetic and smooth. Android L update guaranteed. 4. Good camera with a fast autofocus and shutter speed. No processing time. It also has HDR. Front camera is also decent. You can take selfies if you want.(Although only a 4x zoom on the rear camera. The front camera also has 4x zoom. Its not a fixed focus one) 5. Front speakers are very good, dont have to turn my phone everytime to listen to a song and your ringtone is always audible. 6. Good build quality, it feels really good in the hand. Also the phone is slim, so wont feel bulky at all. 7. I feel the battery is pretty good if you switch on the battery saving mode for your location settings. I am not a heavy user, but I can get 1.5 to 2 days on this. 8. Motorola migrate is a cool app, helped me transfer everything (contacts,messages, media etc. except apps and app data) from my old phone.  Cons: 1. The motorola charger takes very long to charge. I am using my old sony charger which works fine on it.  You can't really complain at this price point. Otherwise just pay more and get a better phone, my best bet would be a Moto X(1st gen) or a Nexus 5. There is just a void in between thanks to the Exceptional Moto G. ;-)  Guys who want a good phone which can do everything, has good hardware and has the latest software. Just go for the phone. The value for money is immense. You will not be disappointed.",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,Indeed the 2nd Gen!,"I recently purchased this product from Flipkart and after hearing many praises for Motorola's comeback phones like Moto G (1st gen) and Moto X. So, I waited for this and I am not even a single bit disappointed.  It is a complete package phone with great pricing in this segment. I cannot think of any other phone better than this in this range.  Screen size has been increased with the same good quality of the previous model.  Nice design and build quality of the phone.  Dual speakers that are good.  Camera quality has also been increased which was a let down for few in the previous model. Dual sim feature which works perfectly.  And the biggest plus point is the External Memory Storage Slot. I cannot think of a single reason why someone would not go for this phone at all! Highly recommended.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,One of the Best Value For Money Phones,"The details on spec's are abundantly available and hence I am not going to detail that out here.   I have been using a Samung Galaxy ACE (for personal use) for more than 3 years and a Blackberry Torch 9800 (for work) for about 2 years. Since I have had enough of lugging two phones wanted a dual SIM phone with decent specification that would not get outdated soon and didn't want to buy any of the flagship phones.  Zeroed in on ASUS Zen 5. Waited for more than a month for it to be available. Last Friday got a notification from NDTV Gadgets on my Tablet that MOTO G (2nd Gen) was going on sale at 12:00 AM of Saturday 6th SEP'14. On re-checking non availability of ASUS Zen 5 proceeded and completed the purchase by about 12:05 AM. Got it delivered by lunch the next day (7th SEP'14). Kudos to Flipkart.  About the Phone with 1 week of usage.  Pros : - Stock Android 4.4.4 and since there is no custom UI quick upgrade to L - Ample Real Estate. 16 GB on the phone with 12 ~ 13 GB usable is great! - MOTO Migrate assist quickly got me up and running by moving most of my data - Used Data card for VCF from Samsung and Bluetooth to copy contacts from BB. Quick - Being a stereo handset, sound quality while streaming from GANAA is good. - Through your usage it learns which SIM is being used. - MOTO Assist is a very good tool and one can define actions depending on your activity/location. - Google Drive/Cloud backup - Camera is better than the earlier MOTO G at both front and back. - No lag while playing racing games from EA - Thin enough not to stand out like a lump in trouser pocket - Decent build quality  Cons : - Having used Samsung I started missing the gesture for calling/messaging. Overcame with an app called exDialer. - Battery life could have been better. But of course I have my office push mails being sncy'd and also use the phone daily as a GPS. Last's a day.  - Non-availability of Screen Guard and good bumper case at launch is a problem. and hence I am being extra cautious while using the phone currently.  Overall great VFM.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,4 stars,Detailed Review,"With lot of enthusiasm, I ordered Moto G on the day of launch, around 12.30am, 6th sep. It was delivered on 08th of sep. It's been 7 days since I am using the product.  Pros : a) At first glance, looks bigger and decent in your hands. b) Screen scrolling is smooth, looks slimmer on sideways 3)Dual speakers not only increases sound throughput but also adds to the look. 4)Back cover is nice. 5)Moto Alert and Assist are useful softwares which are inbuilt in Moto G 6)Response time is quite amazing.  Cons: a) Camera quality is not up to the mark. I did not believe that pics taken on this phone are from a 8mega px camera. Big no to all those who are looking for superior cameras. b)Front camera is okay. Not Too good,  c)Battery life is hmmm... below average :( d)Charging the battery requires lot of time.  Guys, just don't see pros and cons, weigh it with price and Motorola brand!! I feel putting 13k of money on a smart phone with 5inches display, quad core processor,dual speaker,decent memory, 8mp camera etc etc with definitive brand like Motorola is no doubt a good buy :-)!!!!

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,4 stars,Nice one from Motorola.,"Will provide detailed review later. Delivery was somewhat fast. There was no USB connecting cable with the set. I had to buy that separately. And there is no option to bulk delete contacts. Everything else is fine though. Camera is good. Performance is also nice. 16 GB internal memory means you can have a lot and lot of applications. Battery need to get charged in may be 7-8 hours if you use connectivity the whole time.. Considering the size of display, that is okey I guess.. Have not tried to play videos yet.. I think 720p will work.. Not sure about 1080p though. Overall I liked the phone..

The buttersmooth functionality is amazing and I was sure I have to bid goodbye to the lagging issues of my older phone.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,Best Value for Money Mobile,"I might be bit late to write review on this. I received the phone on 8th Sept 2014, two days after the launch. I have explored a phone in past 5 days. Following are good features I observe 1. Very Good Camera (8 MP) 2. Sleek look 3. Memory Slot (expandable up to 32 GB) 4. Motorola Assist in built App (Which automatically set my phone status to sleeping after set your Sleeping Time.) 5. Great Touch Experience which let me play my favorite games Subway Surfer, Temple Run etc without any lagging  Cons which I observed 1. Very Much Heating Charger 2. I can't play game with listening to FM 3. During Charging, sometime Touch behaves very strangely, like if I opened any App it automatically called my last dialed number.Or I am trying to do something but it was doing something else...Has anyone face the same 4. Although the RAM is 1 GB but very quickly occupied. 5. Ear Phones are not good. But its okay.  I am exploring more and will post more.... But I can say that it is more than value for Money Product.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,Moto G JUST GOT BETTER,"Retains all good characters of 1st en moto G in terms of performance. few points to consider 1)screen though increased to 5"" which i liked but the downside is the screen brightness and colour reproduction is not as good as the previous model,i am not talking about the decrease in ppi to make it clear.VERDICT:Lovely screen but not the best.  2)camera has definitely improved but don't expect it to take sharp pictures.Again the colors coming out of camera seems washed out and you would find high noise in indoor shots.Outdoor shots are better and video recording is smooth but again you would feel the need for secondary noise cancellation due to unwanted wind noise.VERDICT:Definitely not a camera phone,but good at the price range and a sure improvement.  3)Sound output has improved due to dual speaker,but you cant make out the stereo effect that they claim or may be i should get my ears checked.VERDICT:Well thought by placing speakers at the front which has improved the audio output.  4)SD card Slot is a welcome addition though limited to 32 GB  Finally you get what you pay for and is surely an improved phone and retains all characters for which we loved moto G.",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,4 stars,The Best in 13k,"Design-  The new Moto G borrows all design terms from its older sibling but the striking difference is that it features a bigger screen size than the original. Because of the size, it is no longer compact as it used to be and is almost as large as the new Moto X. The construction is better and it features front facing speakers now with the volume as well as power buttons in the same area as it used to be.  Display-  Dont be surprised because the refreshed model now features a really big 5-inch IPS display with a resolution of 1280 x 720 pixels. The original phone was at 4.5 inches which was really compact and delivered a premium feel without being too big to hold. But, that is now long gone because most people asked for big screens and Motorola gave it. The 720p is bit less for its size but text and apps are still crisp as ever. Color reproduction is still decent and the overall display quality is above average in most scenarios.  Performance-  We were a bit disappointed to know that the second generation Moto G didnt receive an upgrade in the processor area. It is powered by the same 1.2 Ghz quad core Qualcomm Snapdragon 400 processor with the same 1 GB of RAM. The screen size is now much bigger than its older version but in daily tasks it didnt lag or show any kind of issues. However, there are slight hiccups when running modern 3D games. The phone has an Adreno 305 GPU to take care of your gaming needs. It comes in the same 8 GB and 16 GB variant but now has a micro SD card slot for expansion.  Camera-  The camera has been bumped up to 8 megapixels in the rear and 2 megapixels in the front. On all bright shots, the camera performed fairly decent. So, if you are planning to take pictures of your holidays and in office, you are sure to find it cool unless you step into some night shots. There is an LED though to help you out.  Battery-  The 2,070 mAh battery should carry you through the day with 3G turned on, occasional social networking, phone calls and some games. We easily managed one day on full charge with basic usage. The phone offered nearly 7 hours of talk time which is good enough.  Verdict-  With an increased screen size, latest Android Kit Kat and micro SD card slot, the new Moto G is a worthy phone especially with a price tag of Rs. 12,999.",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,4 stars,2 Days Delivery of a very Good Product,"Excellent delivery service although I had to pay Rs.90/- extra for it. Ordered it on 10th Sept almost midnight and got the product on 12th Sept in the morning around 12 noon.   Review after first looks in the hand. Black Beast. Its 5 inch screen is appealing. With dual speakers sometimes its confusing to know the upside or downside but in due time will get used to it. Has excellent memory of 16GB with the price range. Along with it, the product has very smooth and excellent user interface of Android Kitkat 4.4.4 out of the box and a guarantee upgrade to Android L acts as a jelly on the top of the cake. Rest all the features are great and you can browse specifications for them.  People are complaining of USB cable I think they are technologically backward since nowadays who uses a USB cable when you have a WiFi connection and an Air-droid Application which easily gives you access to whole device in-&-out that too with a superb web user interface.  As for battery backup details I have charged it today in the morning around 10am and calls, whatsapp, facebook, sms, email, times of india, alerts are frequent enough already, but still battery is drained only 50% till evening 6pm which is quiet enough for a daily usage point of view and so many apps running in background on 1GB Ram its a very decent performance although in couple of hours I might I have to rush for a charger but its fine with me.  Although its been just 1 day with the phone but I think its the best in class phone right now available in the market with excellent features.  Rest is your own decision. I rate it 4 out off 5. One star deduction just for costly back covers available online which will also decrease in due time may be after launch of Moto X (Gen 2); who knows lets see.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,Brilliant- Best phone below 20k,"The Moto G 2nd Gen is the new King of the budget phones. It's basically an evolutionary upgrade to last year's killer phone- and that's not a bad thing. It brings so much more to the table at a ridiculously low price of Rs. 12999 (Rs. 1000 less than the older version). I'm writing this review after three days of continuous hands on time with the phone. Pros-  1) Pure, stock android. Motorola keeps android as it should be- clean, pure and blazing fast with no added bloatware. 2) Guaranteed upgrade to Android L. 3) Design. The new Moto G looks amazing. It's bigger screen is beautiful, and the back fits comfortably in your hand. The construction is solid and feels really premium. The phone truly looks like a high end device. 4) Front facing stereo speakers. These are a great addition to the Moto G. The sound output is great and watching YouTube videos and pictures is really enjoyable. 5) Micro SD card. Great addition. We always need that extra bit of space on our phones nowadays. 16 GB of internal storage with 32 GB expandable is more than enough. 6) Display. The 5 inch 720p screen looks amazing, the relative loss of pixel density cannot be noticed by the naked eye. Images are crisp and brilliant, which makes reading books and watching movies a pleasure. 7) Camera. The 8 megapixel camera on the new Moto G is miles better than the older version( I have both phones). The pictures are clean and sharp on the new one as opposed to the muddy pictures that the first one managed to capture. The front facing camera is also great to take selfies. Great job by Motorola, this is a great camera. 8) Price. Last but certainly not least is the price. At 12999, this phone is insane value for money. Another winner added to the Moto stable. Cons. 1) Battery life. Battery life is decent but not great like the first model. The phone manages one full day with normal internet use. 2) Same internals as the older Moto G. The internals are the same as the original Moto G. This really doesn't make much of a difference in practice and the phone is fast and snappy. I noticed no lag whatsoever while multitasking and playing games like Asphalt 8, the phone's performance is great. 3) No LTE. This really doesn't matter in India at the moment. 4) No 1080p video. Not really a major factor, but 1080p video would've been nice. Conclusion. Overall this phone is a winner. It reestablishes the position of the Moto G on top of the budget smartphone segment. All in all, it is a great upgrade over the original. People looking for a great smartphone which can do almost everything a 'Flagship' can without spending a fortune can go ahead and buy this phone with confidence. Motorola is a trusted brand and the after sale service is also great. All this makes the Moto G 2nd Gen a champion phone and the best phone in it's price range in my view.",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,Nice one in this cost range,"Features provided by Motorola are astonishing in this cost range, You need not to waste time in thinking to choose among Moto G/MI3/Zenfone 5 In this cost range though Moto is providing moderate battery backup when compared to other two, it is reliable brand. One should also have consciousness of service centers if you had any repairs with your mobile which brings moto ahead in this class Product Quality is good in all aspects of design Now when it comes to Battery change if battery losses its capacity after 1-2 years of heavy usage, you may perhaps visit service centers(since battery is inbuilt) rather than doing it by yourself Camera Quality is good, performance of processor is smooth and fast, so no problem with large apps. Screen is pretty good(both in quality and clarity) and with gorilla glass My sincere advice don't wait for cost of Moto to come down if you want to get it, before cost may come down it will be out of stock..

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,1 star,Be Careful with Flipkart Service,This is not a review about the phone. It is about the flipkart delivery service. I bought it on saturday and it was supposed to be delivered on sunday. The status was updated that the item was out for delivery on sunday. I did not receive the phone till evening and called flipkart customer service. I was told that they wont delivery on sunday !!! which is not correct. After sometime i checked the status online and the status was shown as customer requested the delivery to be postponed to monday . I never requested it but a wrong status was updated. I shot a mail to flipkart customer service but so far not received what happened to my complaint except that they have forwarded to relevant department. The major reason anyone is buying is because of flipkart customer service. But i have seen it going down for the past few months.   Rating it 1 just for the pathetic and worst customer service .,,Verified Purchase
Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,Super phone satisfied,"Like other I got the phone in less than 12 hour and for that flipkart rocks. And coming to phone, I think there is no cons in this phone. Display is great, touch is very good and giving decent battery life of 1 day means 24 hours. One thing can be improved that is ear phone. Currently it is a good quality but it can be better. And camera is very good and night photos are very good in HDR function mode. The most important thing of this phone is the both the speakers are placed in front of ur phone and while watching any Vedio it rocks.   Overall experience is very good.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,Perfect phone at this price,"First thing to tell is that this is a perfect phone in this price range. It is a great comeback to its older version Moto G.  If you by any means compare it with the older Moto G, you will find ample of differences and you would say this 2nd Generation is giving about double the features than what older one gave.  When Flipkart slashed out the price of Moto G as ending sale, even I thought of getting one as Moto G 16 gigs in 11k was a deal worth it. But I listened to my heart and waited for Moto G2. I was expecting it to be a bit higher in price after I read the specs online on technical sites. But to the surprise, a phone with so many things at just 13k, I didn't even blink an eye to order it on first day itself.  Great things i found with this phone :  1. Config is gr8. Although today each and every phone in market has a such config with 2 cores or 4. 2. No speaker on back. Two speakers in front of phone. That design of this phone makes me love it. 3. A monster 5"" inch screen  Few things not good :  1. Not much good headphone in the box 2. Back camera not that good.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,Amazing experience (includes a battery fix),"I ordered the phone on 8 September, and it got delivered on 11th. Its been about 2 days of me using the phone.  WHITE OR BLACK : If you are confused as to which one to order, here are a few pointers. 1. I ordered the white one. The back of this phone is not as 'grippy' as is the black one. The black one has a more 'rubbery' back panel, and that helps when in summer your hands are sweaty. 2. I would still prefer the white one, because to me it looks more classy. I was bored with black phones anyway. 3. The white one, in fact, is NOT looking cheap. It is not the disgusting kind of shiny white that other phones have. It is actually slightly creamy off-white, and I love it.  PROS : 1. The LCD display is stunning. As is the resolution. I compared this to a Moto G owned by one of my friends, and the lower pixel density of this Moto G2 (owing to the bigger screen size) is not even noticeable! :) 2. The functioning is very smooth and fast. Downloaded and left a ton of apps running at the same time. Resulted in no lag. The 1 GB RAM is useful. 3. Pure Android. Also, expect to get the newest updates before anyone else with your Moto G2.  CONS : 1. Battery. Runs for only about 7 to 8 hours with normal usage. And I was highly disappointed with this in the beginning. 2. The earphones provided are pure garbage. Don't even consider them. Take it for granted that you will have to buy new ones.  FIX : For the battery, install an app called JUICE DEFENDER. It has seriously increased my battery life to last an entire day. Extremely effective app. With this fix, I have absolutely no more qualms with my Moto G2. :)",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,"Great Fone, but not the best of the bestest.","I'm writing this review after using the fone nicely for 2 days, spending most of my time on experimenting on it, trying new things with the fone as I'm purely new and noob to android OS. I was a blackberry user and now migrated to ANDROID. I was a bit skeptical going for touchscreen fones, as i have always had bad experience using my sisters touchscreen fones, but this fone has proved me wrong, has the wonderful touch experience, much smoother than cheese spread on a toast. Pros-  5"" inch screen size, with nice display, I repeat nice not great. Smooth touch experience. Fast  Smooth Multitasking. Camera is nice(pixelations could be seen if not focussed or zoomed in). Light Weight. Crystal clear sound, but not loud(thatswhy it makes it crisp clear) Moto Tag.  Cons- Could connect it to PC(Windows XP) it shows on mobile connected as MTP but not recognised on PC, downloaded Motorola Device Manager, tried downloading various drivers from net, still no success, read somewhere - installing windows 7 would do the trick, will try that soon. Plastic burning smell comes from headfone jack. Average sound output from songs, not much equalizer options. Takes too much time to charge.

Miromax is offering better specs wise phone ""Nitro"" In the same price range but if you will hold both phones in your had you will see the difference in quality.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,1 star,"Lousy Service, non functional phone","I bought it immediately after it was available. I got it delivered on time. Well done flipkart or WS Retail for that matter. WS Retail is the seller. First impression of the phone was ok types. Having used samsung S2 for few years, quality of the build seemed sub par, but you get what you pay for. So I started to look beyond that and the high spec it has compared to my old S2. It seemed OK, I installed my favourite apps, mostly office related - Good for enterprise etc. It seemed to work. I was happy. And all that lasted just overnight. Since next day morning, the screen became unresponsive. I don't know if it was lock screen. I first wanted to soft boot but as screen was unresponsive I couldnt select the option to Power off :) So, I decided to hard boot it. That didnt fix it. Screen still unresponsive. I got the initial lock screen where you need to draw the pattern. And werid thing - I could see email notification for google mails. so apps seemed to work but screen still remain unresponsive. So quite agonized, I rebooted in safe mode and then wiped the cache. That didnt work. I tried resetting to factory settings.Still not working. Fed up I raised a return request with Flipkart. They were to let me know by Thursday and its Saturday now. No news. So well done FlopKart for keeping the promise of getting back in 2 days on returns.  Incidentally this was also my first purchase with FlopKart. Rather lousy service and shall I say no customer service. It has left a sour taste and I probably will stay away from FlopKart for a while, till it matures enough.",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,Awesome phone at this price.,"I bought this phone from Flipkart on launch day. Thanks to Flipkart for prompt delivery.  Flipkart provided 6 offers to the customers who bought this phone on launch day.  50% off on flip covers and cases is one of the offer which I am not able to avail. I also sent mail to flipkart on this and waiting for their Response.  Coming to Mobile  After lot of research I bought this phone. I was in search of a good phone with big screen,good make , latest software, good camera. Before the launch of this phone i planned to buy xiami mi3 which has high end specs at 14000 rs. Even though it has huge demand I was thinking about the brand, which doen't have any direct service centers in india.... Finally I saw this product on flipkart on launch day after reading all the specs I immediately placed order with out second thought mainly because of the brand and it is android upgradable I hope so. Even you can compare this with Nexus 5.  These are the pros which I feel  Pros: Expandable memory Good battery life 5 inch screen Great Camera  Cons: 1 RAM (compare to Mi3 ..but it is enough for me...) Flip covers and cases are more expensive   Thanks for Reading my post.  Regards, Venkat",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,Awesome Phone,"My wife wanted to swap her iPhone 4S with my newly delivered Moto G2 !!! Flipkary excelled in delivery. Ordered on inaugural day 6th in morning and delivered at Noida on 9th. even though a holiday in between. The phone is awesome for the price. Trusted Motorola's, a 80 yr. old co. & pioneers in mobile communication, product over Xiami X3 even though latter has better specs. wrt RAM, battery capacity, pixel density and resolution. I am very happy with Moto G performance. My 1st mobile in 90's was a Motorola.  PROS:- 5"" display, 16GB storage ( ~12 GB free space with pre loaded apps. & software), Stock Android experience, decent 8 MP camera, sleek looks n design, Dual sim, corning gorilla3 glass, scratch guard, very user friendly interface, Processor speed adequate - no lag experienced, no hanging issue, charger heating up is at normal level, micro sd card slot, water-resistant coating , very light and handy. The screen vibrancy & brightness is very good. The screen vibrancy due to less pixel density, camera, charger heating up as reported in some online reviews is not an issue at all. Motorola has after sales service tie - up in many cities.  CONS:- Battery capacity is ~2000 mah, needs charging once a day with moderate usage. charging takes nearly 2 hrs from 40% to full charge with no mobile activity during charging time. No usb cable supplied. The charging end of charger cable does not have a visual marking on it's top end though a curvature is there to feel it.",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase
Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,4 stars,Good Purchase,"I Ordered the product on 6th of Sept and received it on 12th of Sept. This time a little disappointed by Flipkart.  I had a few problems in my product as i had mentioned in my early Review. >>Ear Phone was not working (After Contacting Flipkart, they refunded amount of my faulty earphone and i brought a new earphone with that refund. Satisfied here)  Pros 1.Display is crisp and touch is smooth and very good. 2.Front dual speakers gives u the best music experience that u wud enjoy even a bad song on it. 3.Camera is OK. Picture quality is fine but lacks functions which usually comes inbuilt in other mobile phones.(Third party apps will do it) 4.Charges in 2.30 hrs as compared to my Lenovo phone which used to take almost 6 hours to charge. 5.Inbuilt 16 GB and expandable memory is just enough. 6.Charger cable length in good and portable too. 7.1 GB Ram is Enough, their is no hanging issue and no lag. 8. Call sound (Listening and Speaking) is clear. 9. Sound on ear phones is just awesome.(I had faulty earphones, but flipkart refunded me amount of 400 RS and i bought a new Samsung earphone, which works like bomb)  Cons 1. Battery is the only drawback in this phone. It drains even if phone on Aeroplane Mode and does not last more than a day if used normally. Continuous use lasts for only 5 to 6 hours. (Used DU Battery Saver Pro, which helps bettery to last longer) 2. No data cable with it(had to buy a new one)  Overall a good phone in this price range, and a brand too, not some Chinese crap.",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

The sound is very very less as compared to Samsung, Philips or iPod ear cords. Have to use a better ear phone, if you are listening music daily. 2. Some apps are not available. Ex: File Manager.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,AMAZING PHONE AT AN AMAZING PRICE! Highly Recommended budget phone!!!!!,"Bought this mobile on monday and thanks to flipkart for the ultimate delivery service! Phone's first impression:- at first sight phone's impression is mind blowing ! a massive 5''inch display gives it a edge and a reason to compete with the other phones at this price range. Motorola has completely  changed the barrier b/w medium end and high end phones by launching moto g(2nd) gen. obviously the ram and processing speed is low but look wise phone is outstanding.  Phone's ram and processing :- phone is carrying 1 gb of ram with Quad-core 1.2 GHz Cortex-A7 cpu and Adreno 305 GPU for gaming purposes.Heavy games like asphalt 8 could be easily and smoothly run in this phone.Phone is presently running android 4.4.4 KitKat with a guaranteed upgrade to android L.  Phone's camera and sound:- If this wasnt enough fr u then moto has other reasons to let u force to buy this phone. moto g(2nd gen ) is loaded with 8 MP with HDR and flash.Camera quality is excellent and with screen having 294 ppi ratio, pictures look amazing.Rather than pics it can record 720p HD video @ 30fps. Now coming to sound ,although moto has provided this phone with dual speakers but the sound is not loud enough.But no doubt quality of sound is amazing.  Durability:- Phone screen is corning gorilla glass 3 which could protect your phone.Phone is also splash resistance means it can resist a splash of water and keeping your phone as it is due to a layer on components of the phone. Moto has also provided this phone with a guaranteed upgrade to android L which will keep ur phone upto the standards of latest phone that will come after KitKat.  MOTO IS A TRUSTED BRAND AND THIS PHONE WILL BREAK PREVIOUS RECORDS !

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,4 stars,"Great Device , but needs improvement","Ordered this phone on 7th minute of launch and thanks to flipkart , got it withing two days .  Now coming to the device , the look and feel of the device is quite good . You don't feel the cheapness of the budget phone . The buttons are tactile and matte finish feels good .  The performance is good , quite snappy , runs apps smoothly , though it lags a little with heavy multitasking . For the price point and comparing it to its competitor ( exclude Xiaomi MI3 ), it delivers well . Games dont lag too . For the camera part , well I did notice , it lacks detail at low light , and a little grainy , but good enough for social media uploads . the front cam is good . Battery performs well , but i expected a bigger battery than 2070 mAh , It just manages to drag about a day . I start for my college at 9 and return back at 6.30 and still have 20% left . Usage includes a little gaming , whatsaap , fb , twitter , browsing , and music . So overall a good buy :)",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,4 stars,Excellent Product from Motorolo !! DELIVERY WAS UNBECOMING OF FLIPKART !!,"Awesome product from Motorola. The screen size and the display clarity with the crystal clear sound is excellent. I just got the phone a day back and was checking out the pics using the 8 pixcel camera and its really awesome. The touch screen too is par excellence.Watching videos on this phone is crystal clear and its a pleasure watching videos on this phone. I would rate this phone on a scale of 5 as 4 and above but not 5 though. The quality of the finish of this phone is great. Its super sleek with the curved body is as good as any high end phone. You pretty much feel light weight on your hand when you are holding this phone. All in all its a value for money phone and I would recommend to buyers who either want to switch from their old android phone or somebody who want to probably upgrade to a better one. Also, this is good for first time android phone buyers too if you are looking for a sleek and excellent quality phone. I am just loving it as I discover the features on this phone while using this. My only complaint is that, Flipkart disappointed me for almost a week to deliver this product with so much of follow up from my end. I have purchased almost a bunch of products from flipkart earlier and I never had any regrets till I bought this phone from them. They really let me down by keeping me waiting for almost a week. I had to email and phone back and forth with flipkart CSR folks for almost 5 days which is something unbecoming of Flipkart. It was very frustrating from flipkart that they can treat their customers like this. Looks like this is a one off case, but still I feel that Flipkart has faltered on its promise and the area in which they were considered to be very strong, they failed miserably. In my experience with Flipkart till date I never experienced such a inefficient delivery like this till I bought this product. In this case of mine, Flipkart just did not have any control on the delivery once the product is shipped from their warehouse, they were unable to take control of the delivery and all the promises they made through the 5 days of my interaction with them on the horrible delivery was just very annoying. Anyways, just wanted to caution the customers that, Flipkart too falters sometimes, so don't just go blindly that Flipkart is the best in the delivery. Definitely not in my case for this order !!",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,3 stars,Motorola could have done better !!,2nd Gen Moto G is a successor to Moto G launched earlier this year which had shaken the segment of low cost phones. Mobile technology is moving very fast and low cost phone market is now dominated by Micromax (and other Chinese re-branded phones) and Xiaomi. Although Motorola gets a full credit to bring revolution in this segment its a time that they have to fight for their position. With 2nd Generation Moto G they have almost got the things right but by adding Snapdragon 600 processor and Full HD screen would have immediately put this phone in forefront once again. After Xiaomi Mi3 launch customer expectations have risen and now they are looking more value for their money. RedMi 1s based on Snapdradon 400 phone sells at half the price of Moto G. So Motorola could have done better .,0 of 1 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

First of all, with all new 5 inch screen and front speakers it looks very premium.. Android Kitkat 4.4 out of the box with zero bloatware makes sure the phone is responsive and fast... Expecting it to be better with Android L update which is promised by Google for this device..  Primary camera being 8MP is good when compared with earlier MotoG, secondary 2MP camera does decent job too..   With 16GB of internal memory and extendable memory slot, MotoG2 has overcome the drawbacks of its predecessor..   With scratch resistant default back cover and release of exciting colorful back covers, it gives you an option to customize to your style..   Some would still crib saying it has just 1GB of RAM and it still uses Snapdragon 400 processor.. But to be frank, DONT ever go with specs.. They do matter to some extent, but its not that a phone with just a GB of more RAM is an awesomme product..  Overall.. MotoG2 wins the race yet again in this mid range phone market with the likes of XiaomiMi3 and other products..",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,Product worth the Penny !!!,"This is what i feel like after using it approximately for a week. The device is worth each penny which i payed, and flipkart what should i say the best got my product way far before the guaranteed delivery date.   I tested my phone out in Quadrant Benchmark and came up with a result above 19000 which is pretty good with a device of this budget. The display is extremely good and crisp. The phone supports up to 10 touch points ( Its good, even though i have never used all of them together till date ). Battery life is awesome, you can take the phone to the limits whole time and would stay with you throughout the day.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,3 stars,SIM and WCDMA issues.,At first I could not find the option of selecting GSM mode or WDMA mode. I downloaded third party software for it and it got resolved. But now I am facing SIM issues. I originally registered my Airtel SIM in Slot 1 and it was working. Recently I re registered on Idea as i was not getting 3G coverage.  Now I want to switch back to airtel but I cannot find Airtel operator if i search manually or automatically for network carriers. So i put the Airtel sim in slot 2 and it worked and I registered on Airtel carrier.  But I cannot register on airtel carrier if I use Slot 1.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,Why Moto G is the best,"First of all let me salute flipkart. Big logistics giants should learn from you. Ordered the phone on wednesday 11:23 PM and got it delivered on friday. Bangalore to Kochi in less than 40 hours.   Initially I thought of buying mi3. But I needed a phone that can be operated using 1 hand, Moreover I dont want such a powerful phone for my needs. I was also fed up of the flash sales and purely manipulated demand. The only reason why mi3 is popular because very less people get it and there is always a demand for something which is not common.  Here goes the pros 1. Fantablous design. It looks like a trimmed nexus 4. Giving it a luxury look 2. Light Weight 3. HD screen is awesome with great viewing angles 4. Dual Speakers gives us a quality loud music 5. even though it has a 5 inch screen it can be easily handled using 1 hand 6. latest android 4.4.4 with guaranteed upgrade to L 7. Both the rear and front cameras does a great job 8. Quad Core processor for ultimate performance  Some people say about the pathetic battery life. But for me the battery stays 24 hours with moderate usage. No games  Conclusion It's the best mid range phone and with the price tag of 13k, it's is a steal deal from flipkart.",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,The Complete phone at an Awesome price!,"I'm really satisfied with this buy. The Phone is really amazing and more importantly, It's really affordable and It's got the Android 'L' update guarantee! Okay, I'll break my Ratings into sub sections:  Build Quality: 8/10. Overall, the design and build quality is good, but, the volume button and lock screen button is a little shaky, so, that's why I'm giving it an 8  Screen: 9/10 It's exceptional. With a pixel density of about 290 ppi, It's got the best screen at this price range! Color reproduction is amazing and the screen plays HD Videos really well!  Battery: 6/10. It's been 3 days now, A little too early to judge,but, I'm a little disappointed with the battery. The battery drains out quickly and I'm forced to put it on power saver mode when it hits around 50%. Also, the phone has some overheating issues while charging. Moto has to work on it. Hopefully, with the release of Android L, thanks to project Volta, I expect the battery life to improve!  Audio Quality: 10/10. It's Awesome, to say the least. Sound quality of this phone is fab and it's stereo speakers perform as marketed! It's super powerful and it plays Music and other audio's with any distortion or other issues!  Performance: 7/10. For this price tag, the preformance is pretty good. it's plays most casual games pretty well without any lags and the frequency of FPS is pretty good too. Adreno 305 does it's job pretty well.  Other features: 9/10. it's got expandable MicroSD card upto 32GB, Internal memory of 16GB, 1GB RAM, It comes with near stock android with guaranteed updates, among other things and at last, IT'S BEEN DESIGNED BY GEKKY ASSES AT GOOGLE!  Overall: 9/10.  For it's price tag, it's a super worthy buy if you're upgrading from a lower end Android phone.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,Awesome at the price range!!,"Very good service provided by Flipkart, mobile was booked on the lunch day and was delivered within 48hrs.   Pros:  For a Daily usage and for a budget under 15k this would be the best and a reliable phone. Front Speakers are pretty loud and clear does not distort, 5 inch HD Screen with Gorilla Glass 3 fwould sustain any rough usage/accidental fall,  Decent Camera pictures taken looks good,  Battery life seems to be well managed last for 24hrs for a average usage(10 - 20 calls, browsing, watching videos and reading books),  regular Android updates and Expandable Memory nothing more i could ask for 13K.  Cons: Image Stabilization in camera whiile taking pictures or videos would have been great. Slow Motion Editting in vidoes does a bad job.. :(  RAM could have been increased to 2GB.  Verdict: Go for it cos this would still be a product of Google even though Motorola Managements shifts to Lenovo. Best and Reliable mobile under 15K.

As far as phone is concerned, No one can beat it. Just Superb. No provision of DATA Cable is the only issue. Mind boggling performance. Screen is best. Music played by the front speakers are GREAT.   Love it like anything. Those who are in the market for smart phone and has the budget range of 10000 to 25000, go for it. For those who are low on budget, just stretch a bit and enjoy MOTO G.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,Excellent Phone with Unbelievable Price. But Late Delivery By eKart,"Hi all, Shrill here, Ordered 6th sept 2014 and got 11th sept by Slandered Delivery.  I was looking for a smartPhone with same features as Moto G 2nd Gen.  last Saturday i opened my flipkart application and filtered my requirement for a smartphone. and my requirement was as under 8 mp cam. atleast 8 GB internal atleast 1 GB RAM more than 4.5 inch HD screen dual sim.  and i filtered same as above.. and added the brands samsung, sony, LG, HTC, Motorola. than i opened next page and went to price ""Low to High""   ""ON TOP OF ALL SMARTPHONES MOTO G 2ND GEN WAS THERE""  what else a person can get at this price yaar.. !!  some peoples are following brands like samsung, sony, LG, HTC, Apple and etc..  But I personally think that ""following brand is waste of money but following good and excellent features at reasonable price is worth of money""  anywayzzzz..  I got better than my requirement..  8 mp HD rear cam (Preety Good).. 2 mp front cam. (Very Good) 16 GB internal and i can extend to 32 GB (Best) 1 GB ram is enough for me for gaming and other apps. (Sufficient) 5 inch HD screen for mutlimedia .(Awesome) Speakers are very clear and loud.(Interesting) Dual Sim too..(Beneficial) very smooth running device.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,1 star,Very Bad experience with Flipkart & Motorola,I have ordered the product on the launch day midnight. The same day delivery option came only in the morning. No option at midnight. Even though i am in Bangalore it got delivered only after 2 days. The headphone jack is not working for me. Raised the complaint next day. Now 4 days gone still they are yet to come back.   Even i have raised the issue with Motorola. No response from them also.   They launched some defective products in the market & both the parties don't even care about the customer that he has a defective product which he brought with great enthusiasm.  It makes me feel like it is better to go to the store & test everything have a feel on the product & buy it. Flipkart is making me to go nuts. When i call they always say we are busy we will get back. My question is why are they selling too many items if they are not able to handle the customer???????  Already many of my friends & family are against the online purchase & this experience sets me a humiliation there also.  I recommend that don't buy these flash sales & launch products from online. Better go to shop & buy a good tested product by you.  After all everything is Android and all have their own advantages & disadvantages. So it makes no difference to buy from online retailers.,,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,4 stars,A good mobile specially considering its price.,"The features of the Moto G (2nd GEN) are the best in class... you would not find these in any other mobiles priced 13000 INR.. Now i got the mobile yesterday and had been all over it. I have tried to check all aspects.. These are my views...  Camera: Good both front and back one shoot clear photo and with a powerful flash photos are even better at night. Also vidio recording is very good. Battery: Still the battery is low, max tym of 18-20 hrs with normal use. But now heating or other problems. Performance: Very good... though the phone hangs while using 3G net but thats becoz i have too many tasks going on, but it resets itself to normal in no tym. Looks: Killer... Not so slick, the curve on the back adds to the appeal, tad thicker but u wouldnt mind it it fits in ur hand nicely, and YES to 5"" screen though it uses more power it rocks.  I would say go for it if ur requirements are features and fun, but if u need to work heavily or opting for good battery backup then this is not suitable for you.",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,Awesome Mobile,"I purchased the mobile on the launch day. About the mobile, well at the price point its an amazing phone. Works without lag. The phone lasted a day on 3G and I was accessing the connection for 8 hrs. On wifi connection with regular use the phone lasts for 1 and half days.  The overall experience is pretty good.   Now coming back to Flipkart experience, for the first time, I had a bad experience. While shopping it showed next day delivery (I am a Flipkart first user) and after I made the payment, the delivery date changed and it said standard delivery, means it will take 5 days to deliver the phone. Also the delivery was not by eKart but a courier - Delhivery. I called up Flipkart call center and reported the issue, they replied that its only standard delivery in my area and they cant do anything about it. The package was delivered in 2 days.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,4 stars,A decent device at decent price!,"Best things: 1. Great Price 2. 5 inch screen looks great, and excellent for one hand operation. 3. Back cover is not slippery, and mobile feels premium quality, even though it is plastic. 4. User Interface is basic, with no blot-ware 5. You will get more than 4 hours of screen on time with auto brightness, and gps. 6. Kitkat as it does not eat up your ram.  Average Things: 1. Snapdragon 400 is now getting old, but still a decent chip. 2. Do not expect wonders with the 8 mp camera, but that does not take away the fact that pictures taken has great detail, and front camera is great for selfies. 3. Sound quality is better than many devises but nothing in front of HTC boom sound.  Bad things: 1. 1gb Ram is quite less, and some times the cell phone may stutter. 2. Loud speakers during call are not that great 3. screen does not feel premium quality while using, (could be due to humidity)  Verdict: Better than any Samsungs mid range devise, and a great update to the previous Moto G.",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,Nice upgrade from Nokia N8,"I bought this on the midnight when it was launched. I was previously using Nokia N8, so this is quite a nice upgrade to it as far as operating system is concerned. Camera on N8 is just awesome, 12mp, Carl Zeiss optics with xenon flash. So Moto G won't win in this aspect. But performance wise Moto G is miles ahead of the N8, as it is Quad-Core with 1Gb of RAM. Now the much talked aspect of Moto G is the BATTERY. I must say that battery backup is not good. Motorola must have upgraded the battery from the old Moto G, it should have been atleast a 2300-2400 mah battery. Because same battery as the older Moto G will definitely underperform given that rest all specs are same and screen size has been upgraded from 4.5 to 5 inch. Rest all good.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,4 stars,Wonderful product at a wonderful price,"I had ordered this phone immediately after the launch, and I am happy that I did. After using this phone for now 3 days I am pretty much satisfied with it. Below are my experiences.  1. It looks and feel very premium. Actually it looks and feel better than many of the high   end phones. 2. The display is good. Even though it just has a 720 p display it hardly has any pixelation.  3. The battery could have been better but it will last a day with normal usage. The battery   saver mode that kicks in after it drains to 15% is really good because after 15% the   remaining battery takes longer than usual to drain. I am currently able to get 17 to 18   hours of battery life out of it.  4. The sound from the front dual speakers are fantastic. 5. As there are almost no bloatware, the interface is very smooth and responsive. I was   little worried when I came to know that it has only 1 GB ram. But Motorola has   managed the hardware and software in a fantastic way. I have played Asphalt 8 with   out any issues on this device. 6. The only disappointing parts are the accessories included in the box. The earphones   are of a very bad quality and the charger is a regular non detachable one so you will   need to buy a separate USB to Micro USB cable if you already do not have one.  So I would definitely suggest you all to go for this product.",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,Moto G Version 2 Truly an Exceptional phone no doubt....Moto>Xiaomi>samsung,"Happy with the buy and keep up the good work Flipkart... One Day delivery....   Now about the Phone  # Larger screen: The new Moto G looks almost the same as the old one, but has a slightly bigger screen. The new model has a display larger than the old model by 0.5 inches but with the same screen resolution. The 5-inch 720p display on the new Moto G produces good colours and has satisfactory viewing angles  # Improved cameras: The Moto G (2nd generation) comes with enhanced cameras. The megapixel count on the new Moto G has been upped from 5 megapixel to 8 megapixel for the primary camera, and 1.3 to 2 megapixel for the front camera.  # Additional storage: A significant improvement in the second-gen Moto G is that it offers expandable storage. The addition of a microSD card slot in the second-gen Moto G indicates that Motorola took the feedback seriously. The company recommends to use a microSD card of not more than 32GB.  # Dual speakers: Unlike the old Moto G that came with a speaker grill at the back, the new Moto G has dual speakers at the front that produce fairly loud sound in a normal room environment..  Overall - Amazing... And a confirm update to Android L.  Though Xiomi may show more features its sure it will only for 1 year. The chinese company factor.  Guys U can close ur eyes and go for moto g.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,1 star,WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EXPERIENCE OF MY LIFE,"Lesson learnt: Never, ever, buy from flopkart.   I ordered two Moto G 2nd gen phones on launch day, when flpikart was offering a bunch of deals with the phone. My package was shipped immediately by the seller, and arrived in my city the next day.   For the next three days, I'd get a message from flipkart's courier partners indicating that my order would be delivered that day, get no call or notification from the delivery agent, and finally not receive my package at all.  When I proactively tried to call the numbers messaged to me by their courier partner, my call was not received.  This drama repeated itself until the actual date of delivery. The next day, I woke up to an email from flopkart saying that my order was cancelled as it could not be delivered.   When we called flopkart's customer service, we were told to put in another order, which meant that we would no longer have all the deals we'd gotten earlier. The customer service agents also had no sense of accountability: - none of them could determine where the package was  - no-one stuck to their word, and tracked down the order - none of the promised phone calls were ever received.   I am no longer interested in doing any kind of business with flipkart again, and will definitely NOT re-order the Moto G phones.   Motorola, if you're reading this, you made a BIG mistake making flopkart your exclusive online partner. For every satisfied customer, I'm sure there are a few like me out there, who determine that the headache of working with flipkart is not worth the benefits of the phone.",,Verified Purchase

The battery life is surely THE BLACK SPOT on the great device, slow charging, and lasting till evening, working hard to squeeze a day of juice, neither the capacity nor optimization is good , its really the big let down, Motorola should look into the issue, may be a free upgrade for battery too (just kidding but please do some serious optimization without compromising on functionality) 2.the notification drag down menu don't provide with toggles but shortcuts to setting, that's bit bothering .

Good enough space (16 gig internal, max 32 gig external and also otg facility) 5. One day long Battery 6. Gorilla Glass 3  Bad points: 1. UI is not like samsung mobiles. U cannot re-arrange apps in the main app drawer 2.No music player ( Play music is good but we cannot share music via bluetooth) 3. No file manager or file explorer 4. we cannot switch on n off the wifi from the status bar  Overall i would like to say that moto g 2nd gen is a pretty good phone except some small problems.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,First Week Impressions with Moto G - 2nd gen,"After using the phone for 1 week, i must say that i completely satisfied with the product. An average user doesn't need very high end specs for the phone. Moto G comes with a snapdragon 400 chip which is more than adequate for all the functions. Not a single time did i notice a kind of slow down or lagging. The screen is perfect even though it is just 720p.  Pros: Fast and responsive. No lagging of any sort. Amazing stereo speakers (puts my previous galaxy S4 to shame) More than average battery backup about 4-5 hours of screen on time. On an average i get about a day and a half of use with wifi, 3g and gps on all the time. Camera is brilliant (though not as good as samsung S4). The HDR mode is just impressive. Distinguished appearance. The S4 looked cheap like a 10k phone. The Moto G actually looks like a 20k phone. Moto Assist (an app) makes your life insanely easier because of the contextual alerts.   Cons: The phone is heavy!!  The screen is very prone to attract finger prints.  Overall: Moto G does have everything that you need in a phone, except for playing games. It is distinguished looking, good battery backup, good screen, and a promised update to android L.",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,4 stars,A Decent Budget Phone,"First thing first. Flipkart team - You're awesome in delivering. I ordered on 6th September and though the tentative delivery date was 10th September, I received it on 8th September afternoon. This is superb.  As far as review of Moto G (2nd Gen) device goes; Well I have just used it for 3 days and the hands-on experience till now is amazing.  - The phone is pretty fluidic. Touch sensitivity is great - 5-inch screen with 720p display is good if not exceptional. But this makes sense when its Snapdragon 400 under the hood. - Moto Migrate option is just cool. It took me just 3 minutes (over 3g network) to transfer my entire old phone into this device. - Best thing. It looks and feels better than Moto X which costs another 10k more. - Camera output both front and rear, is reasonably good. You get some crisp pictures (with adequate light though) to shoot. Low-light photography however is a disappointment. - Another great feature in this device is that both the Sim Cards can access 3G/2G network. So you needn't worry on connectivity part. - Wi Fi and Bluetooth worked absolutely fine. - Basic games like Temple Run, Subway Surfer, Candy Crush etc run perfect. However, with heavy gaming like Asphalt 8 or Mortal Kombat, there is a lag at times. Though very slight. You can still play these games at ease. For that matter I found the stutter and lag in Note 3 as well which is way too costly a phone.  Overall, I am a satisfied and proud customer to have Moto G (2nd Gen). Its a great deal for sure with the upgrades.",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

I really loved the finish of the mobile, with large screen and curved looks. I own an andriod mobile old version less configuration and wanted to upgrade so, bought this.  5 stars for FlipKart for quick and timely delivery...  Looks: Great phone for decent price, awesome device design just fits in any hand as the mobile is slim (width) and large (height).   Charging: It was boxed with 50% charge, I had to charge 1Hr 30Min to get full battery.  Performance: The mobile is loaded with very basic gadgets/apps. Have to download lot. I have connected to my wifi and started setting up few apps. Downloading and installing is quick. The view is pleasent with 5Inch display. Email checking and Facebook are awesome.   It is almost a day passed and I am still left with 73% charging... with below stats  Screen: 35% Mobile standby 27% Idle: 14% Android: 8% Android OS: 5% Google play: 2% Others: 4%  I have done some configuration changes.  Disabled wireless network when not in USE Under SOUNDs - disabled all unwanted notification tones/sounds  Handsfree: I have tested the ear phones and I found it be decent for the price that we paid.

(This literally killed my excitement for the phone :( )  Firstly,i love the feel of this phone,its touch is just so perfect...i have only found the touch of Iphone more smooth and buttery than MOTO....  The Corning Gorilla Glass 3 is absolutely Scratch Free!!!(Not even a single scratch be it scissors,metal keys...jst bring them on :P)  POWER & VOLUME buttons: The one thing i was a bit disappointed at the beginning was its Power And Volume Buttons(they have little wobble).MOTO G's buttons were perfect.Now i am pretty much used to them.... some users have mentioned that their power buttons are very stiff.... so hopefully my piece is not defective...as many users have same complains like mine.  Camera takes awesome pictures at night...while during day tym it performs above average.  But overall no complains....its a stunning masterpiece at this price. No other phone can compete this phone @ this price....  Chinese brands not even qualify to compete against this phone.  Just go for it...Its a worthy upgrade....

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,1 star,FM radio with phone speakers ?,"It is claimed on Flipkart that Fm works with both head phones and via Phone speakers, I dont think thats the case unless I missed out something! guys please check and comment in here if you guys have the same issue!!  These guys on Flipkart now have changed the description regarding FM. Initially it was mentioned ""Enjoy free music in the air with Moto G's FM radio feature.You can now tune into your favorite FM radio stations and play through your headphones or the phone's in-built speakers."" That has been changed now. This is sheer act of misleading customers. Not expected of Flipkart to indulge in this sort of practice.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,Totally satisfied with Moto G (2nd Generation),"First up thanks to Flipkart for faster delivery. Bought the phone at 1:25 AM on 6th September, the launch day of Moto G 2nd Gen in India.   Let me tell you, I am Windows Phone 8.1 user, and this is my very first Android Phone.  The first impression is mind blowing, I mean it doesn't makes you feel that you're using a 13K smartphone. It feels solid in hand and gives you smartphone experience like you've bought some 20+K premium smartphone.   The design is great, I think 5-inch is just the perfect size for a smartphone. The sleek design and premium matte finish at back, feels rich. At the front there's a duo of stereo speakers, and this always confuses me, what's the right orientation to pick up the phone. However, now I look for blink light, and front camera, to hold the phone rightly. The phone doesn't feels heavy in hand.  Coming next to the display, it's beauty, 720p resolution feels just right. Watching HD videos is a pleasant to eyes but, yeah I still feel the display could be a bit more bright.  The front duo speakers outputs quality stereo sound, they just produce the right amount of sound, when you're at home. However, sometimes when you're in crowd, the speakers sound feels a bit low. (That's what I felt, it could be different choice for individuals)  The stock Android 4.4.4 is amazing, buttery smooth, zero lag, easily handles number of apps under multi-tasking, without even a single sign of compromise in the performance. Also need to mention, it comes with zero bloatware pre-installed, no bundled apps except a couple of Moto apps and a plethora of useful Google apps.  I am not interested in games, however I tried Subway surfers, and honestly it lags, in the entire game play, it has lagged multiple times. Don't know why, despite of the capable hardware. I hadn't tried any other game yet.  Camera, it's fair not great or what you can expect from a 13K device. 8 mp camera takes decent stills, and the flash is very bright. Front camera is also good.   The only issue with the camera, is that it misses focus very often, even in the bright day light. Also I am missing hardware camera button, but that's okay, I looked at the price tag and it made me felt alright ;)  Rest, 16GB storage is more than enough for me, since I barely store any content in my phone. I always use 3G data, and Wifi to access videos and music content, live on the web or via apps  Battery life, yes it'll make you run towards the charger, frequently, if you're a pro smartphone user. The battery can't even last for the whole day, with a single charge.  Bundled, headset, is a pure joke. I wanted to throw them in the bin, but, kept them anyhow.  Anything missing? umm yes, still looking for Flip cover. It's a shame that Flipkart failed to make them available in the stock, still yet. My Moto G (2nd Gen : :D ) looks incomplete without a neat cover. Also, I couldn't find a screen guard for this new phone, still using the bundled screen protector, which has already got lots of scratches.   Alright, in the end, go for it. I really liked the device, hope you'll love it too.",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,GREAT PHONE AND GREAT SERVICE FROM FLIPKART,"Moto G(2nd Gen) as the name specifies its the 2 variant of the earlier Moto G. Not more improvements with processor . But most of the cons of Moto G(1st) has been cleared..  PROS:  1)Handy and Cheap,not at all expensive compared to other brands for same features. 2)From Motorola  3)8MP CAMERA and 2MP Selfie. 4)16GB internal memory with extended memory upto 32gb(sd card). 5)almost Pure Android UI. 6)Runs Kitkat 4.4.4 and Touch is awesome. 7)Dual Sim  Cons: 1)Charger: Gets heated up very quickly. 2)Charger: Does not have a detachable USB cable,It is mounted to the charger. 3)No USB data cable provided. 4)Device gets heated when running intense games though all basic game run smoothly.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,4 stars,Lagging Video Quality,"Writing the review after a day of testing. Everything worked fine except for- 1)There is some issue wuth the sensitivity of the screen. I expected much better response. Its not like the phone lags but it does feel tired, I have used the earlier phone before and found that to be a tad bit better. 2)Videos keep lagging. I have tried around 3 video players other than the one provided and some videos do lag a lot. I dont know where the fault is but they lag. If there is a solution to this problem please post a review about it. 3)This maybe silly, but a basic file handling application should be provided. You can download one but providing one from the start is much more convinient as everyone is going to need it.  Some definite betterments are- 1) Dual front speakers, they take seeing a movie or playing a game on another level for a phone. 2)The improvement in the camera quality if pretty noticeable and a much needed upgrade.  Also the five inch screen may not have been the smartest ideas considering other avenues of improvement such as the battery. Also I personally dont feel the design of the moto g is suited for a 5 inch screen, it looks a bit awkward and the earlier edition definitely felt better in terms of aesthetics.",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,4 stars,Superb Phone !!! Thats Set .....,"Well the I am a bit dissappointed with flipkart. They used to deliver my orders within 2-3 days to chandigarh . Now they take almost a week for deliveries .  Now coming to the device.   The first Look--->  Premium body finish . Perfect Screen Size  HD screen gives a feel as if its a 20k+ device.   Performance--->  Well the phone is totally lag free. Recieved an update for OS kernel build when opened the device. Touch is smooth  Camera( Well now there I sense a kind of dissappointment , I was using Nokia Lumia 720 which had a 6.7mp cam. I clicked pics with moto & lumia and giving a totally unbiased review i would dstill prefer to take pics with my lumia. )  Used the phone for straight 4 hours. Battery backup seems good . For now its a totally great buy for such a price tag .Hoping that I wont face any problem afterwards.   P.S --> Read reviews of other buyers stating they have issues with the charger heating up .

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,10/10 for moto g 2nd gen & 7.5/10 for battery,"hello, basically the build quality is awesome and hatsoff to specifications for a low budget  smarphone.  pros: 1. excellent build quality: 10/10 2. screen : 10/10 ( the best 5"" inch hd display ) 3. speakers: 10/10 4. front cam & rear cam: 9/10 and 9/10 (front camera is too good,more than i expected) 5. gaming: 10/10 (no lags, thumbs up for that :-) ) 6.video : 9/10(since 720p bt yet a great quality of video; i dont say a negative review) 7. blutooth/wifi/celular connections: 10/10(wifi connectivity is the ultimate) 8. touch sensitivity/sensors: 10/10(no words for it, it is ultimate).  cons: 1. as title says, i am little unsatisfied about battery..   after full charge of the battery, i did regular use of the fone like calling, whatsapp,bluetooth,etc...... nearly 1hr to 1.25hr of gaming(high end graphics)... video playing about 20min... whatspp+gmail+other apps updates was regularly i was using... i charged phone @4pm and @12am now its showing me 39% of battery(yet downloading is going on in the background). So, here u can assume urself wat probably phone mite b utilizing battery. i have not given my fone rest since fully charged but yet performance is gud.  2. earpieces: worst to core if u r a music lover.... however u must invest on buying a new earfones for ur benifits n entertainment.. :D...  i would suggest to any 1 to buy this fone if and only if, u r ready to compromise on battery. apart that it is totally amazing!!!   note: all the ratings provided are according to my expectations of phone. mostly all the sections have passed successfully apart from battery performance.. as we all know high end games would drain out the battery. but apart from that its is an ULTIMATE PHONE!!!! :) :) :) :)  THUMBS UP AND CHEERZZ!!! :D",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

The quad core processor handles it efficiently  Battery : Its 2070 MaH battery manages well to run full day in normal usage.  Its Dual SIM Management is good and Noise Cancellation mode is Good too ..!!  IT DOES NOT CUT YOUR POCKETS AND IS AVAILABLE AT VERY REASONABLE PRICE.!

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,4 stars,Good buy for a quality budget smartphone,"Bought this on 6th Sept 00.04 am. being my first purchase on flipkart was really sceptical, Thankfully did not had to face same problems as with xiaomi sales. Ordered this for one day delivery, but got automatically changed to standard delivery. Customer service was not able to rectify this. later on figured out this could not be delivered on 1 day delivery as there was 2 holidays in between. atlast got it on 9th Sept at 4.00 pm  Coming to the delivery....now come one flipkart, where is the contact details for ekart. Just because i ordered a phone should i remain waiting the whole day just for delivery. Can't the courier company delivery boy call up just to confirm when they will deliver. Most reputed courier companies do this.Check your competitors for this!! Also most who gave positive reviews for delivery were based in bangalore.   Packaging gave me jitters! Good that i did not order any high end phone, because i found it inadequate for something as delicate as mobile to be delivered from bangalore to Mumbai.  Now coming to phone itself.....  Pros:  if u r in doubt whether to go for this, do buy it , cause it is a great phone for this price I am not going into specs, as u can read it everywhere online. stock android feels good and is fast. love how all the bloatware which others give is missing here :) Call quality is clear and crisp. Wifi , 3G, and bluetooth connectivity is good. till now battery seems good, but it does not seem it will last with heavy use.. like gaming and watching videos. Expandable storage is definately a plus point, which was missing in the last Moto G  Cons: 1) No usb cable...u get just charging cable which is attached to charger. Cannot fathom why moto have done that. 2) Headphones are a let down. Pls motorola, take away the headphones and reduce the price. 3) Phone has a apparent lag when clicking photos. Camera quality is average, but good for this price range. 4) No accessories available for this phone anywhere, not even on flipkart. Why did Motorola choose to launch the phone and not the accessories? not even scratch guard!  Overall would recommend this to anybody.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,now this is a lethal combination of good specs and low price,"from the moment of unboxing this device till today,i.e 3 days old ,i just cant get my eyes off this phone.okkk now that might sound a little over exagerating but thts true its a brilliant phone and since it runs on stock android which is beautifull , it opens apps really fast.i have the white piece which looks stunning and feels premium.the screen looks sharp and is very responsive.i tested it by playing asphalt 8,real racing 3,and some other low graphic games and this phone does not stop surprising me.asphalt nd real racing ran pretty smooth..no lags..the new android 4.4.4 experience is really amazing.i previously used samsung and i must say after android 4.4 there is no need to buy phones with custom UI.it has a guaranteed android l upgrade and i am 100 percent sure that android L will comfortably win over all user interfaces from high brands.i have sony XB 400 headphones and they perform exceptionally,even better than my galaxy note 2.already installed lots of apps only 3 gb user memory left but still no hangs or glithes.i use a galaxy note 2 and the screen quality is not as good as the note 2 but u wont notice the difference if u havent extensively used a highj end phone.i am loving this phone and the pure android experience the only con i felt but not a big one though is that the battery life is okkk.i am saying ok because it is not that bad.one thing u have to understand is that u cannot use location services,wifi and browsing and expect the battery to last long.but u can switch off location services and set moderate brightness and battery saver mode when using wifi...after doingso m having a great battery life...motorola assist is a great feauture u will come to know abt wen u buy this amazing phone",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Best touch screen experience so far for me. Voice clarity is amazing. Happy with the new sd slot.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,Dream phone,"It is my dream phone and was planning to buy it since last 3 months..... but this new launch of 2nd generation was like adding stars to my dream and finally bought it on the day of launch..   It has no lag so far and have very fluidic way of transitions and touch response.  With the added feature of expandable memory up to 32 GB will result in number of increase of buyers for MOTO G, those who were delaying the buying of moto g giant for the reason of limited 16 GB memory (as, I was one of them :P)  8 MP camera is just up to the mark for such low price phone..  HD display, two stereo speakers in front is the very well improvement.....  At the end, I just want to say that it is fab. and with such price tag is just phenomenon..

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,4 stars,A overall nice product with few glitches,"Well, I was using Samsung Wave ( BADA) before this. But I have seen and observed other android mobiles closely.   Was impressed by the first look of the mobile. Sleek and Sexy. Pretty big but still handy. As i checked the manual. It shows two mic. One at the top and one at the bottom, but I cant find a mic at the bottom. I mean there is no hole for a mic. Then i opened the back cover. It was hard to open it( May be because it was new) , but then i managed to do it. Now its working perfectly.  Then I inserted the micro Sims and the memory card. I must say the positioning of slots is done smartly.  Then I switched on the mobile. The little intro animation was awesome. I used all the features ( actually i was checking it ) for about one hour.   Here are my conclusions.  I would rate an overall rating of 4 out of 5 for this mobile. Almost everything is very good in this mobile. I am loving it but I was able to find few glitches in this mobile.  Glitches are :- 1. The internal memory shows 12 GB. 2. The charger heats up very quickly on charging for only about 30-45 mins. 3. The earphones are of 3rd grade quality. 4. I feel that the mobile is little powerful for the given battery. The battery is same as the older MOTO G but specifications are better than MOTO G. But this is not a big deal. I worked on this mobile for around 10 hours downloading all stuff and setting it according to my needs. The mobile data was on for almost 5 hours. I listened to music, played games. And after all this the battery showed 15 % at the end of the day. So that is okay with me. It depends on person to person according to their need.  5. File manager app is missing. How can MOTOROLA miss this thing?   6. The mobile showed a error while i was transferring contact files from bluetooth recived files to my contacts. Though is it ok now but it was a matter of concern for me.  Thats it.  Overall the mobile is fine for the price I got it. I have seen other android mobiles too and those were pathetic. So GO FOR IT.",0 of 1 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,MOTO G2-Is it a worthy successor?,"Received the replacement handset today as the sim slot of previous phone was disabled. Technical team said that there is an issue with use of cropped sim so buyers use a micro sim issued by your operator.  I own MOTO G and the first difference I noticed was that the MOTO g had better finish both inside and outside. MOTO G2 looks too plasticky on the inside. The screen is great but lacks the contrast when compared to MOTO g. The blacks show as deep grays. Having said that, it comes down to personal preference. If you like warmer colors you will not notice the difference. The bigger screen does make an impact and is very inviting. You will indulge!  Camera is definitely improved on MOTO g2. You will not be disappointed with the results if you know how to take pictures.  MOTO g2 is as zippy as it's predecessor but the available ram after a reboot is about 300-330 mb which is lower than MOTO g.   The speakers on MOTO G2 are loud and quite clear. The call quality is great too.  Though it is quite big yet strangely it feels lighter than MOTO g. In reality MOTO g is lighter than g2.   One hand operation of MOTO g is not difficult. The phone balances quite well in hand.  The headset provided are usable but not for music. You will have to spend another Rs. 1000-1500 for decent headphones so the effective cost of handset goes to 14000-14500. I tested the music player using the in ear headset of LG Optimus black. G2 won't disappoint you in music department.  I think it is a great phone and for a new buyer it's a great deal. But will I sell my MOTO g and get it? I will. Though 0.5 inch increase is not much but it makes a huge difference when it comes to a mobile phone screen.   I would recommend this phone to everyone who is looking for a great phone for a low price.",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase
Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,i m satisfied with the product.....,"A good mid-range Android phone.  Here are the first impressions -   1. Screen: Nice, crisp and vivid, but only 720p. With Snapdragon 400, I guess 720p makes more sense than 1080p. It is 5 inches in size but feels compact and usable in single hand. 2. Performance: Android 4.4.4 comes pre-installed. Lag-free so far. Runs Riptide GP pretty well. Should run all games meant for Snapdragon 400. MS Office, Facebook and Google Drive all work fast and fine.  3. Sound: The front dual speakers are awesome. Very nice sound. None of the other Motos (E/G/X) so far had this kind of fidelity.  4. Camera: 8 MP main cam & 2 MP front. Very good snaps so far both indoors and outdoors. Got only 20 mins to experiment :) 5. Call quality: 2 mics with noise cancellation and a loud speaker! Feels good. 6. Micro SD Slot: This is the greatest inclusion. Moto G sorely missed that. Good option. 7. What else do you want? :) C'mon guys what else do you expect from a phone at this price point? It won't cook your meals or solve your financial problems. Use it practically. It's a good deal. The Moto Google combination is working out for the masses!  Will get back after a week or so with extended usage report.",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,4 stars,Value for money!,"STORAGE:  a significant improvement in the new phone is that it offers expandable storage. The addition of a microSD card slot in the second-gen Moto G indicates that Motorola took the feedback seriously.  CAMERA:  The megapixel count on the new Moto G has been upped from 5 megapixel to 8 megapixel for the primary camera, and 1.3 to 2 megapixel for the front camera. Camera takes amazing pictures when HDR mode is on.  BATTERY: The battery life as of now is quite good but in the longer run I am skeptical because of no significant increase in the battery power which was used in the predecessor MOTO G.   ACCESSORIES: A USB cable along with other things should have better. The quality of earphones are not up to mark.  OVERALL VERDICT(4 out of 5): The phone by Motorola is a value for money and you can go for it. It seems MOTO is here to stay.

I was pleasantly surprised how despite maintaining the larger screen size and no upgrade on the screen pixels, it still provides a rich colourful display. The performance and battery consumption also remains respectable.  The Moto G remains as a great value for money buy again.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,Awesome phone,"1st to mention is quick delivery and 'Bad packing' of flipkart. And better build quality over the previous moto g. Even the sim slots and sd card slot have been neatly managed. Everyone knows about the phone's good part. Same speed, bigger screen size, little improvement in camera. What impress me about Moto g is its stock android and super speed. And of course, upto date software version.  Con's- I personally didn't like the speaker configuration. Though the sound quality is good, the phone vibrates while playing music. Sometimes it feels like buzzing sound.  Not complaining, but Ram size and battery capacity could have been improved.  Otherwise, i liked the previous moto g and also liked this one.  Thanks Motorola for sd card support and bigger screen size.",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Camera  Front camera and rear camera are better as compared to handsets at this price tag. ignoring few granular view during dim light. Andriod Operating system upgradation They have marked the possibility of OS upgradation. Processing Speed Processing speed is great as I tried playing Asphalt 8 it works fine.  Acessories Charger is good in design but issues is with compatibility as it doesnot fit plugpoints. Cable missing needs to be provided by Motorola. Headphones please try providing capsule/in-ear for better sound quality. Try pricing it for more Rs.500-1000 bucks but provide this ,as its just a suggestion.  Suggestion  Flipkart as you are sole distributor for different manufacturers like xiaomi, Motorola , so before launching these handsets please plan for providing acessories as its hard for finding it in market. Third party acessories distributors can also work if official company is not launching these acessories like screen guard, flip covers, panels, etc.  In all Flipkart and Moto rocks, at this pace MOTO can be a popular name in Indian market !!!",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,4 stars,Moto G (2nd Gen) first hand review,"I got the phone on Monday and after a full day of usage, I found Moto G (2nd Gen) as a best phone at this price.  Pros: large but perfect screen dimensions and you would enjoy more when you start playing Asphalt 8 on the mobile. No lag and the screen display is awesome. watching videos was really cool with those front speakers. But at large volume the noise increases a bit. The built quality is pretty good and doesn't seems like a low budget phone and there is no resolution problem either with a pretty good viewing angle. Camera is ok ok but need to hold a bit steady. Video recording is much better. Pretty light weight and handy.  Cons: Battery is getting drained little quick and around 80% of battery usage is becasue of screen. No USB cable in the box which is a big demerit and kind of stupidity by Motorola and Flipkart.",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,4 stars,Much Awaited Phone Proved to be Good!!!,"Ordered it on Flipkart on Saturday (6th Sept.) and received very well on Monday (8th Sept.). Pretty fast!!!   On the Performance of Phone: 1. Very nice display with extremely good colour and pixel density. Although it is 5"" display with 720p display, not a single pixel can be found even from close inspection. All the videos in Full HD (1080p) played nice and flawlessly. 2. Performance is smooth without any lags... 3. The dual stereo speakers are much mych better than many Entertainment laptops. Placing the phone just below the face and listening produces an excellent surround sound effect. 4. Inclusion of SD card is the best thing. This was the reason I waited for this phone to be launched in India when it was announced in June, though it does not include the 4G LTE which was announced earlier. 5. Headsets are good in sound quality but since they don't contain earbuds, so listening in crowded places is a big problem. 6. Both the cameras are very good in quality but auto focus take some time to properly focus. 7. Personally for me, the presence of Pre-installed Quickoffice was a boon!! 8. Battery seems average but actual performance would be clear in a few days. Yet I'm not very expectant of it. For a 5"" screen and the type of config it has, maybe a bigger battery of approx. 2500 mAh or higher would have been better. 9. The charger gives an output of only 550mA so charging takes a lot of time. (3-4 hrs approx.) 10. More setting should be directly accessible from the notification area. This problem was present in the previous MOTO G as well.  In all the phone is VERY VERY good for its price. Hoping to get much more from it in coming days!!!! A definite buy suggestion..",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,BANG FOR THE BUCK! Indeed Exceptional,"I ordered this brand new Moto G (2nd Gen) on Sunday 07/09/2014 and got it on 08/09/2014.  As expected awesome job by flipkart. Keep Going Guys you're great.  NOW COMING TO THE DEVICE -  It has been an awesome feeling using this phone. It's smooth , NO LAGS , screen size is excellent and most important is that they have given a micro-SD space for the users along with its 16gb internal memory (you get around 12gb or so).  Now i have used this device continuous for 10 hours.. with Hardcore Games.. and it gives a great response with absolutely zero lags. You get 1gb of ram so multitasking is easy like anything .   CAMERA : It has a 8MP front camera (with flash + HDR) and at the back it has a 2MP for decent selfies. I tested the front camera and surprisingly it gives a great quality of images (Both in Low Light and outdoors). What a like about it most is it's HDR feature .. trust me when you use that while clicking images .. you will be blown away by it's 1080p HD picture quality and details. Another thing is video recording which it can record upto 720p HD. What i like here is the slow motion feature and you can record videos in slow motions.  That's it folks .. It's a great device .. better to say A BANG FOR THE BUCK!

The Camera got better now with 8 Mega Pixel and 2 Mega pixel front camera. I have checked the camera, and it's improved really well. The screen of this moto G sec generation seems as if it's an AMOLED. It has impressive color saturation. The old Moto G had greater Per Pixel Index yet it is not better than new one in terms of display quality, motorola has done some magic on it's screen.   My view is that it is second best phone in this budget after Xioami Mi3, ofcourse Motorola is known brand and reputed too.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,The best value for money phone in India right now!,"I own a Nexus 5 and a Nexus 4 and a Nexus 7 2013 and have really high standard when it comes to Android smartphones(My first Android was the awesome Samsung Galaxy S2, may it rest in peace!). I got this phone for my Mom as she did not want a really high end phone as this is her first Android phone and she is still learning. And Moto G 2nd Gen has really impressed me so far!  Here is my review!  Pros: 1. Excellent In-A-Day Delivery by flipkart, free for Flipkart First subscribers :D 2. Best value for money phone at best price. 3. Great, crisp screen with really nice color reproduction. 4. The front stereo speakers are really loud and sound great! (They blow my Nexus 5 and my dad's Nexus 4 out of the water in this area) 5. 13 GB free space and SD Card expansion slot upto 32GB! This is an awesome inclusion over the 1st Gen Moto G. 6. Really fast, super responsive UI and operation. No lag on most popular 3D games like Asphalt and Temple Run2 etc. 7. The phone's back feels really awesome and has a soft touch finish just like the Nexus 5. 8. Curved backs facilitates an awesome grip. 9. Running the Latest and Greatest version of Android Kitkat 4.4.4 with minimal bloatware and minimal ugly UI customization. 10. Peace of mind knowing that Motorolla has good customer service in India unlike some other Chinese offerings by flipkart(Cough* Xiaomi Cough* Cough*) 11. Dual Sim, just in case you travel frequently between 2 roaming circles! 12. What more can you ask for in a phone at this price point?  Cons: 1. No USB cable included. The charger's cable is fixed to the wall adapter.(In european countries, moto G 2nd gen includes a USB cable but no wall adapter, but here in India they reversed the trend for some reason!) 2. Really below average earphones that look and feel like toys meant for kids. 3. No Left and Right ear markings on the earphones. Ugh! 4. They could have added more RAM, 1GB seems too less for today's super intensive 3D games.  If you are looking for the best Value for Money phone in India right now, then look no further than the 2nd Gen Moto G! Get is at once and only via flipkart as they are the fastest and most reliable! :)",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,4 stars,My First Android Phone (A Beautiful BLACK Beast),"Ordered best mid range phones   Still exploring, will update more later.  Here are the first impressions -   1. Screen: Nice, crisp and vivid, but only 720p. With Snapdragon 400, I guess 720p makes more sense than 1080p. It is 5 inches in size but feels compact and usable in single hand. 2. Performance: Android 4.4.4 comes pre-installed. Lag-free so far. Runs Riptide GP pretty well. Should run all games meant for Snapdragon 400. MS Office, Facebook and Google Drive all work fast and fine.  3. Sound: The front dual speakers are awesome. Very nice sound. None of the other Motos (E/G/X) so far had this kind of fidelity.  4. Camera: 8 MP main cam & 2 MP front. Very good snaps so far both indoors and outdoors. Got only 20 mins to experiment :) 5. Call quality: 2 mics with noise cancellation and a loud speaker! Feels good. 6. Micro SD Slot: This is the greatest inclusion. Moto G sorely missed that. Good option. 7. What else do you want? :) C'mon guys what else do you expect from a phone at this price point? It won't cook your meals or solve your financial problems. Use it practically. It's a good deal. The Moto + Google combination is working out for the masses!  Will get back after a week or so with extended usage report.",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase
Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,4 stars,Value for Money - Happy with the display (comming from Amoled),"Ordered the Phone on 6th and received it on 7th afternoon, I paid extra tough for the In A Day delivery   Transitioned from Galaxy S (CM10.2) to Moto G2  At 1st glance - Good fit and finish, and nice feel of the surface area (rear). Removed the protective sheet, the screen is a fingerprint magnet. The speaker grills at the top and bottom gives the phone a balanced look. After a day it still takes me some time to identify to top side from the bottom.   Ergonomic - I thought upgrade in size by an inch (4 to 5 inch) would not be easy and it is not easy ! . I prefer small phones which make the handling easy, fuss free and single handed. For me operating this phone with a single hand is quite difficult, but it is not that difficult while talking though. Buttons on the side a easily accessible, as they placed a bit on the lower side.   Performance - There was no comparison as my old phone was SLOW as CM10.2 on 512MB RAM was an overkill. So there is not much I can talk here. However it meets my Expectation of speed of response (fast or slow , I don't know)  Camera - Not tested yet , I don't use it much   Display - Very Happy with the display. I was a bit sceptical while buying as I liked the AMOLED display. This phone did not disappoint me, this was the most imp feature as display is the only thing I see the most on the phone.  Display has good colour reproduction, good contrast and sharpness of characters.   Games - I only play Sudoku and Bubble Shoot :)  Speakers - Simply Awesome and thoughtful. For most of the phones I used, they had to be cupped in such a way to let the sound reflect back. They had speakers at the back or somewhere else. With 2 front firing speakers the experience of watching videos is a very good the vocals are clear and so are higher frequencies. On the lower side of the sound spectrum the reproduction is not that great, I have not tinkered with settings yet. overall a great experience.   Battery - Not sure yet , but the charging is slow.   Box, Packaging and Support docs - For the 1st time I actually read the Quick start guide of an Electronic Product I ever bought. It was Useful ! I sorely miss the Data cable, yes data cable is not included. Quality of the headphones is average, just tested them for a minute. I use MDR-XB21EX.   Over all a good experience, it meets my expectations at this price.",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

The simply curvy black look provide it a dashing eye caching look. Two large silver bars suggest we???ll get stereo front speakers next time, much like the HTC One M8. weakest part of moto G that is a 5mp camera upgraded to 8mp. Bigger screen as compared to older moto G (4.7inch =>5.0inch). The addition of micro sd slot has made it more impressive at memory level. Overall not very big and falling changes can observed but still a decent update from Motorola in the same price range.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,A great smartphone for a great smart Indian,"I ordered it on the releasing i.e, on 6/9/14, and the expected date of delivery was on 10/9/14, but to my surprise, i got it on the very next day itself (7/9/14), Thank you Flipkart :)  The fone is fantastic, i'm using moto G (predecessor) and bought 2nd gen for my """", and now i my mind is fluctuating for 2nd gen. anyways i still love my first moto and first smartfone.  Pros: 1. The looks are better than motoG, more handy with all that curve 2. Primary Camera(8MP) and secondary (2MP) are better than its predecessor even in night time 3. Expandable upto 32GB, however for people like me 16GB is sufficient, but expandable option is for those who like to store alot of movies/Video songs etc. 4. Speakers are front faced which is good, but i felt the effect is same as its predecessor 5. The home screen is more pleasing than its predecessor 6. and many more  Cons:  Well, i dont have none for the price m being offered, however, some i've observed are: 1. The home screen wallpaper does not move when we slide it to right or left. 2. The home buttons could have been placed on the bottom space of the panel to get more space on the home screen 3. The bottom speaker looks like a Back function button  Yet this phone is awesome, for all the first time smartphone buyers, JUST GO FOR THIS BLINDLY, DON'T EVEN THINK OF ANY SECOND THOUGHTS.",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,Excellent Smartphone,"Here is what I think you need to know-  1) Price  Pricing is very decent though not the best.  2) Performance  The phone performs quite well. Definitely not the fastest or the smoothest smartphone but does the job fine. It does stutter a bit with heavy applications but thats pretty much expected form a mid-range phone. The overall functionality is smooth and fast ENOUGH though.  3) Display  The display has been bumped to 5"". That most certainly makes the phone bigger and bulkier when compared with the 1st Generation but then 5'' is the current trend and I am a fan of bigger displays.  4) The stereo speakers!  The phone comes with front firing stereo speakers which have a better sound because the loss of audio is lesser. The speakers have more sound but the clarity at higher volumes doesnt do justice to the higher sound.  5) Design   The one I purchased is a Black Moto G. It looks very elegant as all the sensors sync into the color and the contrasting speaker grills add to a better look. The design is quite similar to the older Moto G but the ergonomics of the original Moto G havent made their way into this since the phone is wider and taller. Not a big deal but thats there.  6) Build Quality  The build seems pretty solid. The design from the new Moto X has been adopted and hence the frame is made of Metal. The phone feels sturdier and looks better. The battery door is much more sturdier compared to the Samsung Galaxy devices. The weight seems more evenly distributed than the previous Moto G and hence it feels lighter. Overall great build quality. A Micro USB Cable in the box would be a great addition.  7) Camera  An 8MP sensor has been added this time but mind you, it cannot record at 1080p. It takes decent photos under normal lighting. The 2MP front camera is a good addition for the selfie freaks(not a fan of selfies :P)It most certainly is an upgrade from the 5MP but could have been better.  8) Call Quality  The call quality has been excellent. Clarity and audibility are better in this than many other flagships.  Verdict:- Great phone at a Great Price. If you are on a budget and are looking for a phone that can put a smile on your face, GO FOR IT!  P.S- The Flipkart In-a-day delivery was excellent. Ordered at 10pm on Saturday and was here by 1.40pm on Sunday. The packaging was good enough and the box and phone were intact. Very satisfied with the phone and the Delivery service by Flipkart.",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,Worth the Price -- Premium Phone,"Hi, I just got the phone a day before and the review is based on only a days use.   1. 5"" Display still fits in Hands very Nicely - Motorola has definitely put a lot of efforts in the design unlike Chinese Manufacturers. Nice Curves :)   2. The overall Specs are more than enough for a (more) than average use (Emails, Gaming, Browsing [calling] .)  3. Battery life Average (rarely some phones give a full day and still ), still you can optimize by not installing every other app. Just install what you need.  4. Looks a lot premium than the Xiaomi Redmi 1s and even MI3 (I own an MI3).  Last one, Moto + Google, So you get all latest OS upgrade/updates 1st.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,Budget friendly mobile with pure android and guaranteed future update..,"Was looking for a mobile. With 5 inch or more. The previous Moto G was 4.5 inches.

Bluetooth headset paired well. Kit Kat 4.4.4 is crisp and fast.??  Con: I am worried about the battery. With 2070 mAh, I don't think it will last for end of the day..

I compared it with a blackberry z10, whereby it appeared better in color rendering but lost in sharpness. it will suit your needs fine for casual shots. lots light photography is better than z10.  addition of sd card removes storage problem.   cons: battery life might be an issue. curved back, the camera lens might be prone to scratches.   verdict: moto g is perhaps the best value for money combining fast software update without bloatware as well as decent processor and cam for everyday use.",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,Fast and very light???!,"First I have to mention about Flipkart speedy delivery. Yesterday (6 sep) around 11:45 am I placed order. I got delivered to Pondicherry today (7 sep) at 1:15 pm. As usual nice packing and safety delivery.  Like Flipkart's delivery, the MOTO G (2 Gen) also fast.   No words about hardware. Everybody knows that. 1.2 GHz Quardcore snapdragon processor, 1 gb ram, android Kit kat, 16 GB inbuilt memory, 5 inch HD display, 8 MP and 2 MP camera, etc.,  Pros: Premium look, slim design, light weight, very handy. Smooth User Interface. No lag. Plays HD videos and songs smoothly and clearly. Screen size is 5 inch, But easy to hold and easy to handle.  16 GB In built memory is enough. If necessary we can add upto 32GB. Screen guard is already there. No need to search for that. Front dual speakers are added advantage for this phone. Call quality Good. Downloads via wifi is very fast. Charges 100% quicky. Lots of inbuilt apps are useful. Guaranteed update for Android L.  Major changes from MOTO G (1 gen) to MOTO G (2 gen) Screen size 4.5 to 5 Fixed memory to expandable memory (card slot). 5 MP to 8 MP, 1.3 MP to 2 MP Dual Front speakers  Cons: Non removable battery.

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,5 stars,What else you want from this Phone !!!,"At first about the delivery.... I ordered this phone with in a minutes after launch and opted for in a day delivery option... But got it today :( .. In a day delivery converted into two day delivery ... Lol... but every one knows flipkart deliver products with in estimated time.. so not a big deal...  Now about the phone... At first you will see you will fall in love with the look and feel of the product.. really awesome look. i will compare it with moto g.. Being its successor you will get big screen, two front stereo speakers with good sound quality and obviously 8 mp rear and 2 mp front camera which is far better than moto g. It is more slimmer and give a luxurious look, when u will hold it u will feel it.. the material used in back cover gives you a strong grip .. so the phone will not easily slip off your hands... Rest all the specifications are same as moto g.  But i only miss one thing that motorola has not launched grip covers which they provided with moto g...Rest waiting for the coloured back covers to be launched ... Those who have not gone through moto g must buy this phone.. Best phone at affordable price.. Kudos :)",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase
Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,4 stars,Review on the flipcart delivery and the specifications only,"Just when i was about to loose hope in flipcart with the deliveries (BANG) i got the moto g 2nd gen mobile delivered before i expected. I ordered the mobile on 6th 00:12 AM and received the product today 7th 3:50 PM Great delivery and one of the best tracking system but i have a doubt whether this is only with the WS Merchant !! I feel so since i ve had bad experiences with a couple of other merchants in Flipcart.  Anyway, my mobile got delivered in the perfect condition.  Going to the mobile specifications: * Seems light weight, a feather compared to some other mobiles * Neat look, slim, classy finishing. Overall looks excellent * The mobile seems fast even though no apps have been downloaded, decent touchscreen  The improvements and reason why i bought this, I felt bad when there was no external card slot in moto g version 1. I looked at the other mobile options and bought a micromax but sold it in few days. I almost got fed up with the mobile searching and was thinking about lenovo although it did nt offer much other than the battery plus the reviews about lenovo were nt that good. At last when i was casually browsing flipcart i saw the moto g 2nd gen ad on 5th sep night around 11. Then i went through the specifications and i thought i ve got what i want.  I felt it is better to go with trusted mobile manufacturers and since google has partnered with motorola if i am not wrong i felt it will be wise to go for moto rather than some of the other android mobiles.  Overall have had a happy experience till now, have put the mobile on charge and hope to start using it soon.",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase
Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,4 stars,Clean nice phone that feels quite good,"Got the phone last evening. Here are my first impressions:  1) Phone feels good - not as premium as the Samsung phone, but for the price quite OK. 2) Set-up - Thanks for Motorola Migrate (an app you need to download - clear instructions in the manual), the transition process from my earlier phone to this was smooth and took about an hour.  3) Issues - I was able to make phone calls, but sms was not working. I was able to see the messages from my previous phones as a list, but couldn't open a message or send a message. After some quick attempts to find a solution, tried the age old solution - shut the phone, removed the sim, reinserted it and started the phone. Still did not work. Did this a few times and was ready to give up. Tried the same after about 2 hours and now it worked. Not sure why the issue was there earlier - anyway now everything works. 4) Interface - Quite simple and intuitive. Some features were different and will take some time to get used to.  5) Camera, Screen, Call quality - excellent  Moving from my Sony Xperia SP to this seems worthwhile after 1 day of use.",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase
Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,3 stars,Good Looking Phone,"I ordered the phone on the day of launch (5th Sept,Friday Midnight) and Flipkart just delivered by Sunday Noon (less than 2 days) and immediately after opening the box, I am writing this review... The phone look really awesome with good sound, video and camera quality...Yet to explore all the features, but as of now I am enjoying the look of the phone...

Mobile Phones, Moto G (2nd Gen) ,4 stars,Decent Phone,I am writing this review after day 1 usage.  1. The screen is bigger than Moto E. Look and design wise both look same. Back cover is not loose like the Moto E. I have loose back cover in Moto E.  2. It has an expandable memory slot which its predecessor lacked.  3. There is no datacable provided with the package. I expected datacable cum charger atleast for a 13K mobile. But it is disappointing 4. The camera autofocus takes time. That way my old Lumia was better with touch focus But was able to get some nice pics after getting used to it.  5. I downloaded Asphalt 8 which is an high intensity graphics game and was able to play the game without an lag.  6. If you look at the specs of some hardware components this mobile may score less with other mobiles in this price range. But the hardware is powerful enough for daily usage.  Go for it! It is a tried and tested model and 2nd Gen brings some good add ons!!,0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase

Ordered just past midnight and was delivered by 11 am next morning ( well actually the same day :) Inside 12 hrs simply amazing.  Coming to the phone- very impressed with the looks and design . So far no hiccups. First experience of Android after having used Apple over the last few years and no complaints so far about the user experience. Perfect size with the increased display , fits in the hand beautifully .  The battery seems to be draining a bit quicker than expected and clarity in the voice wasnt great, although I can only compare between Apple and Moto G , have no recent experience about other phones so my observation could be a little skewed on the voice clarity part",0 of 0 users found this review helpful.,Verified Purchase
